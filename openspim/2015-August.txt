Hello,

Please forgive the super-basic question.  In most diagrams on openspim.org the last mirror housing before the sample chamber is another POLARIS, but in more advanced designs the mirror housing is a larger and unique item not specified in the basic build list.  Can someone let me know what that is?  Many thanks and apologies if this is answered somewhere else,

Tim,

Any 3 axis adjuster should work-that fits your optics.  I ordered three identical 1" Polaris mounts for the recommended 1" mirrors.  I like the 1" because of my big fat thumbs more than anything.  I think the difference in the images might be mounts for ? vs 1" optics.

Do you mean a gimbal mount, something like this?

Thanks folks, I got it.  It's a GM100 ?1" gimbal mirror mount, for adjusting the mirror without changing the axis of rotation.  I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike - lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

All the best,

Hi Tim

Correct. This must be a gimbal mirror mount. Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2 of [Huisken, Jan, and Didier Y R Stainier. 2007. ?Even Fluorescence Excitation by Multidirectional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (mSPIM).? Optics Letters 32 (17): 2608?10.]

Hi,

I'm not sure if there is a way to get around it. I also had a similar  
error. That is, one way is to use the Multidimensional acquisition of  
Micro-manager itself, although then you can't use rotation.

BTW, my Micro-manager doesn't save files larger than 4GB as well, instead  
it splits the stack in one with 3.99 GB size and another one with the  
rest. So the long-term solution is to change the code of the plugin to  
either do the same - slipt the file - or by adding the  "setBigTiff(true)"  
line (if it really works).

Greetings,
Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] How to measure the width of the light sheet and minimize
	the light sheet width?
Message-ID: <tencent_035940B15B0043995CBD670F@qq.com>

Dear, all!
    Now, I have assembled the OpenSPIM as the website described. Also, I have put a grid mirror with a DIV=200um to calibrate the light sheet, and adjusted the position of the telescope system and illumination objective to minimize the width of the light sheet. Then, the image screen showed that the minmum width of the light sheet in the grid mirror was about 11um.(The light sheet width was estimate with the grid size in the same image screen) But I wonder that it is right to estimate the width in this way. Is there any other methods to measure the light sheet width?
    And how can I minimize the light sheet width, since it's also too wide now? 


Thanks, best wishes!

Hi All,

We have just released Micro-Manager 1.4.22.
This is a maintenance release for the main application, with bugfixes
and minor enhancements. There are also enhancements for various
devices and some new device adapters.

It can be downloaded (for Windows and Mac) from
http://micro-manager.org/wiki/Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release
where you can also view a list of changes since 1.4.21.

Thank you all for your contributions and feedback. It's what keeps
Micro-Manager going, so please keep it coming! If you find any issues
in version 1.4.22, please report them by starting a new thread on this
mailing list or sending a Problem Report (from Micro-Manager's Help
menu).

This will most likely be the last release version published by the
UCSF Micro-Manager Team. As previously announced on this mailing list
and elsewhere, Micro-Manager development will be continued by Open
Imaging (https://open-imaging.com/) starting in October. Open Imaging
will be providing future release version binaries as free downloads.

If you are wondering about Micro-Manager 2.0: the plan is to have a
beta version and then an official 2.0.0 release later this year, if
things go smoothly. After that point in time, 1.4.x will be maintained
in parallel for at least a year, perhaps longer.

Best regards,
The Micro-Manager Team

Subject: [OpenSPIM] An error occured when click the "Acquire SPIM image"
	menu button
Message-ID: <tencent_45A971427E3D675750332F05@qq.com>

Hi, all!
   Sorry to disturb you, but I met some troubles.
   When I clicked the  "Acquire SPIM image" menu button to open the SPIM acquired program, there was no reaction. I closed fiji and tried many times and the results were the same. So, I checked the corelog and found some errors.
  The log from the CoreLogs folder shows that :Error occurred in device Omicron: Error in device "Omicron": Duplicate property names are not allowed: Workinghours [h] (4).  detail error log is at the bottom. 
  What cofused me is that the SPIM program could be open last week, and I had done nothing with the software until now.
  The program is the lastest version.


best wish!

Hi, All, 
    Sorry to disturb you again. I solved the error I reported last time. It's nothing to do with the laser property name :Workinghours . The real error to terminate the software is : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid range properties.
    It maybe the number of twister of the PicardStage is beyond the SPIM software can hold. After I set the number to zero with the PicardStage control software, the SPIM software can open.
    Sorry again!

??: [OpenSPIM] An error occured when click the "Acquire SPIM image"menu button



Hi, all!
   Sorry to disturb you, but I met some troubles.
   When I clicked the  "Acquire SPIM image" menu button to open the SPIM acquired program, there was no reaction. I closed fiji and tried many times and the results were the same. So, I checked the corelog and found some errors.
  The log from the CoreLogs folder shows that :Error occurred in device Omicron: Error in device "Omicron": Duplicate property names are not allowed: Workinghours [h] (4).  detail error log is at the bottom. 
  What cofused me is that the SPIM program could be open last week, and I had done nothing with the software until now.
  The program is the lastest version.


best wish!

Hi Evangelos,

I am replacing the obsolete OpenSPIM mailing list address with the one 
that we use since May 2013, so that the OpenSPIM mailing list 
subscribers can see it.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi,

I can only help with point 3.

The newest version of the code is her:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition
As far as I remember, the procedure is to install Fiji and then switch 
on the OpenSPIM update site, then Fiji will install the newest version 
automatically. I was doing some minor changes to the plugin and then 
doing as that page says: building my own plugin, replacing the plugin in 
the Fiji directory. Last time I did it I used jdk1.8.0_51 and it worked.

Regards,
Monika

Hello,

Please forgive the super-basic question.  In most diagrams on openspim.org the last mirror housing before the sample chamber is another POLARIS, but in more advanced designs the mirror housing is a larger and unique item not specified in the basic build list.  Can someone let me know what that is?  Many thanks and apologies if this is answered somewhere else,

Tim,

Any 3 axis adjuster should work-that fits your optics.  I ordered three identical 1" Polaris mounts for the recommended 1" mirrors.  I like the 1" because of my big fat thumbs more than anything.  I think the difference in the images might be mounts for ½ vs 1" optics.

Do you mean a gimbal mount, something like this?

Thanks folks, I got it.  It's a GM100 Ø1" gimbal mirror mount, for adjusting the mirror without changing the axis of rotation.  I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike - lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

All the best,

Hi Tim

Correct. This must be a gimbal mirror mount. Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2 of [Huisken, Jan, and Didier Y R Stainier. 2007. “Even Fluorescence Excitation by Multidirectional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (mSPIM).” Optics Letters 32 (17): 2608–10.]

Hi,

I'm not sure if there is a way to get around it. I also had a similar  
error. That is, one way is to use the Multidimensional acquisition of  
Micro-manager itself, although then you can't use rotation.

BTW, my Micro-manager doesn't save files larger than 4GB as well, instead  
it splits the stack in one with 3.99 GB size and another one with the  
rest. So the long-term solution is to change the code of the plugin to  
either do the same - slipt the file - or by adding the  "setBigTiff(true)"  
line (if it really works).

Greetings,
Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] How to measure the width of the light sheet and minimize
	the light sheet width?
Message-ID: <tencent_035940B15B0043995CBD670F@qq.com>

Dear, all!
    Now, I have assembled the OpenSPIM as the website described. Also, I have put a grid mirror with a DIV=200um to calibrate the light sheet, and adjusted the position of the telescope system and illumination objective to minimize the width of the light sheet. Then, the image screen showed that the minmum width of the light sheet in the grid mirror was about 11um.(The light sheet width was estimate with the grid size in the same image screen) But I wonder that it is right to estimate the width in this way. Is there any other methods to measure the light sheet width?
    And how can I minimize the light sheet width, since it's also too wide now? 


Thanks, best wishes!

Hi All,

We have just released Micro-Manager 1.4.22.
This is a maintenance release for the main application, with bugfixes
and minor enhancements. There are also enhancements for various
devices and some new device adapters.

It can be downloaded (for Windows and Mac) from
http://micro-manager.org/wiki/Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release
where you can also view a list of changes since 1.4.21.

Thank you all for your contributions and feedback. It's what keeps
Micro-Manager going, so please keep it coming! If you find any issues
in version 1.4.22, please report them by starting a new thread on this
mailing list or sending a Problem Report (from Micro-Manager's Help
menu).

This will most likely be the last release version published by the
UCSF Micro-Manager Team. As previously announced on this mailing list
and elsewhere, Micro-Manager development will be continued by Open
Imaging (https://open-imaging.com/) starting in October. Open Imaging
will be providing future release version binaries as free downloads.

If you are wondering about Micro-Manager 2.0: the plan is to have a
beta version and then an official 2.0.0 release later this year, if
things go smoothly. After that point in time, 1.4.x will be maintained
in parallel for at least a year, perhaps longer.

Best regards,
The Micro-Manager Team

Subject: [OpenSPIM] An error occured when click the "Acquire SPIM image"
	menu button
Message-ID: <tencent_45A971427E3D675750332F05@qq.com>

Hi, all!
   Sorry to disturb you, but I met some troubles.
   When I clicked the  "Acquire SPIM image" menu button to open the SPIM acquired program, there was no reaction. I closed fiji and tried many times and the results were the same. So, I checked the corelog and found some errors.
  The log from the CoreLogs folder shows that :Error occurred in device Omicron: Error in device "Omicron": Duplicate property names are not allowed: Workinghours [h] (4).  detail error log is at the bottom. 
  What cofused me is that the SPIM program could be open last week, and I had done nothing with the software until now.
  The program is the lastest version.


best wish!

Hi, All, 
    Sorry to disturb you again. I solved the error I reported last time. It's nothing to do with the laser property name :Workinghours . The real error to terminate the software is : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid range properties.
    It maybe the number of twister of the PicardStage is beyond the SPIM software can hold. After I set the number to zero with the PicardStage control software, the SPIM software can open.
    Sorry again!

主题: [OpenSPIM] An error occured when click the "Acquire SPIM image"menu button



Hi, all!
   Sorry to disturb you, but I met some troubles.
   When I clicked the  "Acquire SPIM image" menu button to open the SPIM acquired program, there was no reaction. I closed fiji and tried many times and the results were the same. So, I checked the corelog and found some errors.
  The log from the CoreLogs folder shows that :Error occurred in device Omicron: Error in device "Omicron": Duplicate property names are not allowed: Workinghours [h] (4).  detail error log is at the bottom. 
  What cofused me is that the SPIM program could be open last week, and I had done nothing with the software until now.
  The program is the lastest version.


best wish!

Hi Evangelos,

I am replacing the obsolete OpenSPIM mailing list address with the one 
that we use since May 2013, so that the OpenSPIM mailing list 
subscribers can see it.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi,

I can only help with point 3.

The newest version of the code is her:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition
As far as I remember, the procedure is to install Fiji and then switch 
on the OpenSPIM update site, then Fiji will install the newest version 
automatically. I was doing some minor changes to the plugin and then 
doing as that page says: building my own plugin, replacing the plugin in 
the Fiji directory. Last time I did it I used jdk1.8.0_51 and it worked.

Regards,
Monika
