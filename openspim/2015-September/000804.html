<PRE>My response isn't really simple but...

I set up oblique illumination and a camera to aid in sample position after occluding the views of the sample chamber with heating and perfusion lines-and a sore neck from constantly checking the chamber during positioning.  It has worked great for positioning zebrafish to organoids.  Right now the illumination is from an old RGB LED board I designed being driven with PWM from a TLC5940 on an Arduino.  The Arduino is also driving an RGB screen for control.  The firmware for the Arduino could be adapted to use a customized version of the Arduino  micromanager driver-haven't gotten to it yet.  For that matter, I'd like the camera feed to be fed to micromanager too.  That's all too much development for me right now though.  I do have an extra RGB board that is populated and could probably dig up a version of the TLC5940 board that is unpopulated(I might have the parts squirreled away) if you're interested-firmwares too of course.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] transmitted light

Hello all,

Has anyone found a convenient solution for transmitted light illumination that can be controlled Micro-Manager? On the one hand you can use a handheld flashlight (torch), which works but is not something you can program.  On the other hand you have collimated light sources from e.g. Thorlabs.  Those do the job but they seem excessively powerful and expensive for what should be a pretty basic task.  I went searching for cheap USB-powered lamps that can be controlled through a software interface rather than a physical switch but those seem strangely hard to find.  As it stands I might put a DIY LED bulb in a cheap 'collimator' like the one below and link it to uManager through an arduino.

Even so I feel like I must have missed a simpler option.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks and all the best,


Tim
