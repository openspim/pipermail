<PRE>Hi, ALL!
  I bulit my OpenSPIM last week, and I began to require data of zebrafish. But the data was registration failed.  The log of fiji was at the last of this mail. I try to change the threshold and nothing went well. 
  I wonder it's maybe something worry with my require processing,  so I descirbe my require processing below. 
  First, I selected a view, then set the Stack-Z = 400, and the step=7.5um, angle=-55.8.
  Second, I wanted to select another view, so I changed the angle to -19.8. But at the same time, I had to change the x-value to keep the the zebrafish in the view of camera. Of cause, the range of Stack-z was also changed. Was this step wrong? I should not change the x-value?
   Third, I repeated the second step to choose another three views and began to require data.
   I hope to get your help！


   By the way, I found the OpenSPIM.app(20150427) can not do data processing. When I did registration, the program alerted that missing 3D Viewer. I try to download the 3D Viewer, and it could work in this compter. Then I copyed the app folder to another computer, it couldn't work again. Was the 3D Viewer not installed in the app folder?  PS. The computer in lab can not access to Internet.
    Thank you！


Best ALL！
