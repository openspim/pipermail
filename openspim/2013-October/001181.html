<PRE>Hi Aurelia,

The build error isn't exactly a chicken and egg problem, but a matter of dependencies: when Micro-Manager is built on VS2010, people without the 2010 runtime can't run it. I recently ran into this problem, and assuming 2010 was backwards-compatible, changed MM to build in 2008 mode. Hence your error; I expect anyone with only VS2010 installed will experience a similar issue.

A possible fix is to use VS2010 to open the solution file, right click on the MMCoreJ project and click properties, and change the Platform Toolset to v100 (I don't recall exactly where the option is; sorry!). You may need to change this for other projects as well, but then the build script should work.

After next week Thursday I should be able to provide a more permanent fix, since Micro-Manager will officially upgrade to VS2010. (The missing files that started all this will be packaged with Micro-Manager, so I only need to resynchronize our code to get all the benefits.).

Regarding the error you're getting, I truly have no idea. I should point out that this is technically progress over the ThorLabs problem; the plugin doesn't try to create a pixel size configuration until it verifies the setup is correct. When it does try, however, it seems to cause an error in the camera device. I can't trace the error yet; if you get the project building, you might check the file/line the core log mentions for clues. I may be able to help further on Monday.

A possible workaround would be to launch Micro-Manager, create a pixel size configuration manually -- as long as it's positive, the plugin shouldn't try to create a new one, and so may avoid this issue.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you come up with anything.
Luke

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is pretty strange. This morning I got the same message in the log about the camera being open already, but I have made absolutely certain that there was not another instance running.  I then tried Live view and Snap, which both work correctly. After this I tried to open the SPIM plugin again, and there is still no response, but I don't get the message about the camera being open anymore.
