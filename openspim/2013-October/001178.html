<PRE>Hi All,

Micro-Manager's Windows build is soon to make a long overdue switch from Visual
Studio 2008 SP1 to Visual Studio 2010 SP1.

This should not affect most users (but help with testing will be much
appreciated).

If you are a device adapter developer on Windows, or otherwise build
Micro-Manager from source on Windows, you will need to switch to VS2010 SP1
(referred to simply as VS2010 below) at the time when the switch to VS2010 is
committed to teh SVN repository.

Currently, I have a private branch of MM building with VS2010. The VS2010
branch is maintained so that it is based off a recent head of the SVN trunk.
I plan to merge this branch with the trunk, if nothing goes wrong, on

  Thursday, October 10.

The nightly builds will also switch to using VS2010 at that time.

The consequence of the merge will be that all VS2008 project files (.vcproj)
will be removed and corresponding VS2010 project files (.vcxproj) will be
added. In addition, various changes will be made to allow MM to build with
VS2010.


What you need to do
===================

## All developers building C++ components

You will need to set up VS2010. Here are the instructions (if you are using the
free Express edition):

1. Install Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1:
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279</A>
(If the installer fails, go to Control Panels &gt; Programs and Features,
uninstall everything with &quot;Microsoft Visual ... 2010&quot; in its name, and try
again. An incomplete installation can seem to work but later cause subtle build
issues.)

2. Install Visual C++ 2010 Express from
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express</A>
(Refuse the invitation to choose Visual Studio 2012.)

3. Upgrade to Visual Studio 2010 (Express) SP1:
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691</A>

4. Install this package to repair VS2010 SP1:
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422</A>

VS2010 can coexist with VS2008 on the same computer.


## Authors and maintainers of device adapters in the SVN repository

- I have ensured that all device adapters compile properly. Since I am unable
  to test most of the hardware, there remains the possibility of library
  incompatibilities at runtime, for device adapters that link to external
  libraries.

- Before the switch date, please download the VS2010 branch build (see below
  for a link to the installers) and test if your device adapter functions
  correctly.

- If fixes are necessary, please do not commit them to SVN before I merge the
  VS2010 branch (unless they are source code fixes that are also compatible
  with VS2008). Instead, please let me know by email.

- When I merge the VS2010 branch, there will be some changes to the project
  files in addition to simply converting from VS2008 to VS2010. Most of those
  changes have to do with centralizing project settings using Visual Studio
  property sheets (.props files). Please be aware of this (details are outlined
  in the next section). Further changes to make the build more maintainable
  will likely be made following the switch to VS2010 on the trunk, so please
  remember to run 'svn update' frequently.

- After I merge the VS2010 branch, please be careful not to commit VS2008
  project files to the repository.

If you keep your own version of the project file, please also see the next
section (but it would be best if you start over with the version in the VS2010
branch, and reapply any necessary local settings, such as library paths).


## Authors of device adapters _not_ in the SVN repository

To continue to build your adapter using the SVN trunk source code after the
VS2010 changes are merged, you will need to:

- Open your .vcproj file in VS2010 and click through the wizard to convert it
  to a .vcxproj file.

- In Project Properties &gt; General, set 'Platform Toolset' to 'Windows7.1SDK'
  (make sure to set this for all Configurations and all Platforms).

- In Project Properties &gt; Linker &gt; General, reset 'Output File' to '&lt;inherit
  from parent or project defaults&gt;' (for all Configurations and Platforms).

- In Tools &gt; Settings, choose 'Export Settings'.

- Open View &gt; Property Manager. For each Configuration/Platform, right-click
  and choose 'Add Existing Property Sheet...'. Choose the
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMCommon.props file in the MM source (only
  available in the VS2010 branch).

- Repeat the previous step, this time to add
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMDeviceAdapter.props. When you're done, make sure
  that MMDeviceAdapter is displayed above MMCommon, at the top the list.

- Go back to View &gt; Solution Explorer and once again open the project
  properties. Reset all of the following properties to '&lt;inherit from parent or
  project defaults&gt;' (make sure to first select all Configurations and all
  Platforms):

  - General &gt; Output Directory
  - General &gt; Intermediate Directory
  - General &gt; Target Name
  - C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Warning Level
  - Linker &gt; Debugging &gt; Generate Debug Info
  - Linker &gt; Advanced &gt; Randomized Base Address
  - Everything under Build Events (there is no longer a need to have a copy
    command here), unless you have special requirements.

  These settings are now set in the common property sheets so that they don't
  have to be set for each device adapter. (We will likely move more settings to
  the property sheets in the future.)

If you prefer, you can test your VS2010 project file ahead of time using the
source code from my private VS2010 branch (see below for downloading).


## Developers who perform full or partial builds of Micro-Manager on Windows

Previously, there were a few Visual Studio solution (.sln) files scattered
around the source tree, and MMCoreJ_wrap/MMCoreJ_wrap.sln contained all device
adapters in addition to the Core and MMCoreJ. Built binaries were placed in
the directories bin_Win32/ and bin_x64/.

With the update to VS2010, there is a single solution file (micromanager.sln at
the source root) that is used to build all C++ components (Core, MMCoreJ,
MMCorePy, device adapters, and the not-very-well-maintained test projects).
Built binaries are placed in build/Release/Win32/ (or the corresponding
directory for the selected configuration and platform).

The fastest way to build several projects (e.g. the Core, MMCoreJ, and a
handful of device adapters) is to open micromanager.sln, right click each
project, and choose 'Build'.


Downloading the VS2010 branch
=============================

The source code, patch set, and binary installers for the VS2010 branch are
available here:
<A HREF="http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~mtsuchida/ephemeral/expires-20131031/vs2010/">http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~mtsuchida/ephemeral/expires-20131031/vs2010/</A>

Once the VS2010 branch is merged into the SVN trunk (currently sceduled for Oct
10), this page will be removed.

Maintainers of closed-source device adapters can contact me directly to get a
copy of the patched source code (the installers include closed-source device
adapters).

I will periodically update the VS2010 branch to incorporate changes to the SVN
trunk.


Q &amp; A
=====

Q: I tested a device adapter from the installer linked above, and it doesn't
   work. How sould I report this?
A: Please first make sure it is working with the VS2008 build (i.e. the current
   nightly build). If it is, please post to this mailing list and include the
   symptoms you observe when you try to add the device in the Hardware
   Configuration Wizard. Please also include the relevant contents of the
   CoreLog (with debug logging enabled). I will work with you to fix the issues.

Q: How do I build MMCoreJ.jar on the VS2010 branch?
A: One additional change has been made to MMCoreJ: the generated Java code is
   compiled by the Ant scripts (i.e. the same way all the other Java components
   are built), instead of invoking the Java compiler from Visual Studio. If you
   want to build just MMCoreJ.jar, after building MMCoreJ_wrap from VS2010, run
   the following command from the command prompt, in the MM source root (Apache
   Ant is required):
   ant -f MMCoreJ_wrap\build.xml

Q: How do I build LibraryTest?
A: Open micromanager.sln, select the Platform, and right-click LibraryTest, and
   choose 'Build'. The output can be found at e.g.
   build/Release/Win32/LibraryTest.exe

Q: Why not keep both .vcproj and .vcxproj in the SVN trunk, so that either
   VS2008 or VS2010 can be used?
A: I'm sorry, but that would be too much of a maintainance nightmare....

Q: Why not switch to VS2012?
A: We hope to do so eventually, and the switch from VS2010 should be relatively
   easy (compared to VS2008 -&gt; VS2010). Just want to take things one step at a
   time. Also, I think it will be relatively easy to build with VS2012 using
   VS2010 project files, as the changes are not as drastic as between VS2008
   and VS2010.


Thanks for bearing with all that.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
Mark
