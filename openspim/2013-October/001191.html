There is really no reason to be sorry about that. Scientists have a track
record of lacking the desire to communicate effectively, so I enjoy very
much that you are an exception!

This is a really awesome picture! Would you mind uploading it to the wiki
and adding it to the gallery? I can help you with that should there be any
problems.

&gt;<i> If I put in a directory, then when I push Snap nothing happens.  It

Could you copy the ImageJ-win32.exe in OpenSPIM.app/ and rename the copied
file to debug.exe and run that? This should give you a console output (I
strongly suspect an exception to occur, which I would be really eager to
see, maybe you could copy/paste it into a reply?).

&gt;<i> If it's a non-empty directory, I do get a message warning me that any
</I>&gt;<i> OME-tiff files will be deleted, but after I dismiss the message nothing
</I>&gt;<i> happens once more.
</I>
It is probably the same issue in that case.

&gt;<i> Has anyone had a problem like this before?  Could it be Windows 7 related?
</I>
Quite possibly. But I can only guess without having a glimpse at the
console output.

Ciao,
Johannes
