Hi Fredrik,

are you operating the lighthub with MicroManager / Open SPIM plugin?
I also have an Omicron LightHub-4 with currently only 2 lasers, but the Openspim plugin is not recognizing any of the lasers. Do you have any idea how to get it working?
? In MM the lasers are visible.

Thanks in advance,

Andreas

-Apologies for the previous confusion; my new mail program handles things a bit differently than I am used to--

Hi Andreas,

>From what I understand MM can work with multi-laser launches but openSPIM currently cannot.  I know at least one case where the user could work entirely through MM except that only openSPIM gives you the option to set a settling time after each sample movement during a stack.  If this is the main obstacle to using MM directly, I wonder whether it would be possible to add an extra 'dummy' channel with the lasers off, and have the camera acquire in this 'channel' for as long as you want the sample to settle.  Just delete the dummy channel at the end of acquisition.  It's a bit of a kludge but it does not call for any coding.

This question is quite relevant for me as I am getting ready to implement an openSPIM 'L' design using two lasers in a Versalase-4.

Best,


Tim

Hi Andreas,

The lasers are controlled in micromanager at this point. We have done some initial test with multi laser acquisitions but have not succeeded yet. We are planning to control the laser modules through TTL using NI interface but that will not be tested until later this year.

Dear All,

I am very new to OpenSPIM and do not have previous experience with regards to coding or ImageJ so I do apologise for all the basic questions.

I have managed to take some practise stack image stacks at 6 angles (300 images - ~2-4GB) but they do not open normally in Image J and the program just says this:

Reading heading file header (Bio-Formats Import Options listing all series), Cancelling thumbnail generation, Import preparations complete - which is followed by nothing.

When I tried pre-processing the images using the macro I used the following adaptions to the code as I only have 1 time-point:

for ( t = 1; t <= 1; t++ ) {
    for ( a = 0; a <= 5; a++ )

As I have Windows 7 64bit, I changed the directory to this:
open("E:\\SPIM_Images\\<file:///\\E:\SPIM_Images\>....spim_TL"

I also attached an exception message I received when trying to process the files.

I must be doing something very wrong and would greatly appreciate any help.

Thank you very much,

Dylan

It appears as if the time lapse might have been interrupted (but this is 
just a wild guess).

You could try to open the files individually by using 
File>Import>Bio-Formats and then adjusting the setting so that it does 
*not* group the images.

Ciao,

Hi Johannes,

Thank you for your email. I changed the settings to open the files without any prompts but it still seems to bring up all the different stacks every time I try to open a file or convert the file types. The files are actually converting now but they are taking >3 hours each and sometimes an error pops up telling me the file type incompatible and will not convert at all.

The macro only converts one at a time too, can it convert them all at once? Whenever I type in 'setBatchMode( true )' I get the attached error.

Furthermore, I also get this warning quite often: 'Could not get charToByteConverterClass!' Any idea what this is?

Thanks again,

Dylan

It appears as if the time lapse might have been interrupted (but this is just a wild guess).

You could try to open the files individually by using 
File>Import>Bio-Formats and then adjusting the setting so that it does
*not* group the images.

Message-ID: <D6DEE6AE-7157-442D-9864-6E0F26F94F4C@uni-koeln.de>

Dear all,

our SPIM (which in fact is an mDSLM) is up and running -wonderful.

This also means that we're producing a lot of data very quickly (typically about 500GB per time lapse recording, about one recording per week). In an attempt to streamline our data analysis and storage workflow, I wondered what your experiences are.

I currently just dump our data on our two 13.5TB NAS servers (a second set of NAS servers is used as a backup). Whenever I want to analyse a dataset, I first copy it to the 5TB internal hd of a reasonably powerful workstation, as reading/writing is often the limiting step for most analysis procedures. After cropping, making Z-projections, 3D registration/fusion etc I copy the results back to subfolders of the original data on the NAS server, creating an ever-growing swamp of data. Until I've finally convinced myself that it's ok to delete the raw data:-)

This "workflow" has worked for me reasonably well, but it is rather difficult to keep an overview of all the data and I just know I'm occupying much more storage space than strictly necessary to answer our biological questions. So I'm investigating the possibilities for setting up a relational database to at least keep track of all the metadata, analyses performed etc. Ideally, such a database would include thumbnails of the imaging data and allow for easy import of metadata. Any ideas? Of course not very "open", but I'm tempted to use Filemaker Pro. Anything else seems like re-inventing the OMERO wheel. Does any one have experience with using OMERO for storing all data from large SPIM datasets? Or would you just store projections and keep the raw data somewhere else? Any ideas appreciated!

cheers,
Maarten

Hi Maarten, 

We ran into a similar dilemma with large volume data from a
spectral-detecting confocal.  Ultimately you either need to invest in an
enterprise-scale storage server or you have to redefine what ?raw? data
means.  We concluded that our spectral deconvolution algorithms were
pretty well optimized and unlikely to be revisited soon, so we archived
the three/four/five-channel spectrally deconvolved datasets as the ?raw?
file and did not keep the 300 GB+ 32-channel original.  Friends who work
with X-ray data from free electron lasers face the same dilemma since a
single ?raw? dataset can add up to 100+ TBs.  The key is to work out how
confident you feel about your processing steps.  If you are likely to
revisit your alignment/cropping protocol then keep the raw data, at least
on platter drives in a closet.  Either way I recommend managing processed
files with OMERO.  I am a big fan of that software and very grateful to
the OME group for making it.

Best, 


Tim

Hi All, I hope the science is treating you well.

I'm just in the beginning phase of setting up a SPIM unit and wondered
if anybody had any recommendations on laser power.  The website says
"necessary for experiments", but I'm not sure how that translates.  I'm
planning on using it for multiple purposes as part of a core facility on
things such as embryogenesis and cellular spheroids.

I was looking at either the 488 Stradus or LuxX based on cost, and just
wondered if anybody has tried them, what powers they have used, and how
well they worked.

Thanks
Neil

I have the 488 Stradus and use it from 1-5mW--mostly I use 1mW. The laser
power control slider in the Openspim plugin window does not control the
laser power, but I can control it from micromanager.

Hi All,

We are currently imaging large volumes that require us to acquire multiple stacks of the same angle.
Is there currently a best way to stitch images acquired OpenSPIM?
Should we use the grid/collection stitching plugin or is there a better way to go about it?

Thanks,

Gabriel

Dear Gabriel,

Yes, stitching should work. This is how the zebrafish example was assembled:

Hi Gabriel,

I was struggling a bit with the stitching step. In the end what worked 
for me is:
first convert to tif using modified script from here:
http://openspim.org/Pre-processing

then use Grid&collection stitching with settings: type=[Grid: 
column-by-column] order=[Down & Right]

It seems stupid to convert images to tiff and lose the metadata 
contained in ome, but I get errors otherwise. :/ If anybody has a better 
procedure, maybe they could describe it?

Regards,
Monika

Hi,

I noticed the following: when the TOTAL about of data (not a single 
stack, but the whole series) to be collected is large (>4 GB I think), a 
following line appears in the fiji console: "Switching to BigTIFF (by 
file size)" and then the files behave differently. For example, 
sometimes I have the behavious that Dylan described: the last displayed 
message in the Fiji status bar is "Import preparations complete", but no 
image ever appears. If the total amount of data is smaller, I have no 
problems opening files. So the BigTIFF behaviour is somehow different. 
But I thought BigTIFF should be only used if one file and not the whole 
series are >4GB...?

By the way, I also get now and then the 'Could not get 
charToByteConverterClass!', also coming from Fiji.

I realize that these are not really OpenSPIM problems, but I'm not sure 
where to look/how to understand it better.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Timothy,

I heard about TeraStitcher and I tried to use it on my SPIM data, but I 
got stuck. TeraStitcher expects a certain format of data, OpenSPIM data 
is quite different, so either the data has to be converted or 
TeraStitcher settings changed, but I failed at it. Could you describe in 
more detail how you do it? You mention a "cheat sheet" in the other 
message.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Monika,

Yeah, terastitcher requires file naming convention that are a real pain in the rear. You need to find a bulk file renaming app or you will go crazy. It literally took us over a week to figure it out. The trick is you need to 'prime' the alignment by working out roughly where your columns sit relative to each other in XYZ coordinate space. In other words the program offloads the hardest part of alignment to the best pattern recognition out there, which is you. ImageJ was useful for estimating overlap and misalignment in Z.  

I am away from my desk but I will post a dropbox link to the list as soon as I can. 

Best,


Timothy Feinstein, Ph.D.

Could you describe in more detail how you do it? You mention a "cheat sheet" in the other message.

Hi folks, 

As promised, here is a quick cheat sheet to terastitcher, at least the version that we used about a year ago.  

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z3kx6etqsn4bn56/AAAzv5boNf0zSh6i0kgp5I_ca?dl=0

The larger file shows a set of 9x9 image stacks, 1000x1000 pixels at 10 um per pixel and a z step of 50 microns (not a real experiment).  The other file is a screen shot of the folder hierarchy that we would make from it.  The first hierarchical level of folders is named for the Y-coordinate top left pixel position (in calibrated units, e.g. nm) of columns 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., 000000, 008000 and 016000 microns).  You have to use six digits for each number.  

The next hierarchy of folders is named for the parent folder _underscore_ the X-coordinate of the top left pixel in each column extending to the right from the column for which the parent folder is named.  These units take into account overlap, so if each volume overlaps with neighboring volumes by 100 microns then the origin of each subsequent volume will be spaced 800 pixels apart rather than 1000.  You can estimate the overlap based on machine settings, but we found that column spacing was not always regular, and got better results by estimating X and Y overlap in ImageJ for each set of neighboring stacks.  

Now for the hard part.  The last hierarchy is the image files.  These are named after the parent folder _underscore_ the Z position of each slice in calibrated units.   The Z position is absolute - this means you have estimate how every stack relates to the first or highest stack, whose top slice is at Z position 0.  The first slice of every other stack will start at a different positive integer.  We measured the Z misalignment by scrolling through neighboring stacks in ImageJ to see where they lined up.  You have to relate the starting position of each stack to its neighbor and so on until all of them exist in the same coordinate space as the highest stack.  Then you can name your files.  Like I said you basically can't do this without a bulk file naming utility.  
	
Having done the hard part yourself, Terastitcher then performs non-rigid alignment to give you one single stitched file.  The alignment itself is remarkably fast, even on computers with non-ludicrous processors and RAM.  

I might have exaggerated a bit when I say we worked it out in a week.  I think it was more like two weeks.  Naturally we started with an experiment where the sample must have touched the objective a little so overlap in X, Y and Z was all over the place.  When stack acquisitions go more smoothly you can sometimes get away with assuming one overlap value across the board.  

Hope this helps!

All the best,

Hi Timothy,

I heard about TeraStitcher and I tried to use it on my SPIM data, but I got stuck. TeraStitcher expects a certain format of data, OpenSPIM data is quite different, so either the data has to be converted or TeraStitcher settings changed, but I failed at it. Could you describe in more detail how you do it? You mention a "cheat sheet" in the other message.

Monika

I am currently thinking of using Gelrite, but any suggestion would be more than welcome.

Hi Arnaud,

I've never used it with OpenSPIM, or on a lightsheet system having a
similar design for mounting, but CyGel or CyGel Sustain from BioStatus
might work.  It offers improved optical clarity over agarose.  Also, it is
a liquid at cold and becomes a solid at room temperature or higher, making
it easy to recover live samples.  Its main drawback is cost but otherwise I
really liked it when I tried it on a confocal and on a lattice lightsheet
with live squid embryos and hatchlings.

I'd be curious to know how it goes, if you or others give it a try - or
have tried it.

Good luck!

Hi Arnaud,

I was planning to also try various tubing materials in the future. This paper has a nice comparison of a few different capillary types which you might want to have a look at.

Good luck!

-Apologies for the previous confusion; my new mail program handles things a bit differently than I am used to--

Hi Andreas,

>From what I understand MM can work with multi-laser launches but openSPIM currently cannot.  I know at least one case where the user could work entirely through MM except that only openSPIM gives you the option to set a settling time after each sample movement during a stack.  If this is the main obstacle to using MM directly, I wonder whether it would be possible to add an extra 'dummy' channel with the lasers off, and have the camera acquire in this 'channel' for as long as you want the sample to settle.  Just delete the dummy channel at the end of acquisition.  It's a bit of a kludge but it does not call for any coding.

This question is quite relevant for me as I am getting ready to implement an openSPIM 'L' design using two lasers in a Versalase-4.

Best,

Hi Andreas,

The lasers are controlled in micromanager at this point. We have done some initial test with multi laser acquisitions but have not succeeded yet. We are planning to control the laser modules through TTL using NI interface but that will not be tested until later this year.

Hi Andreas,

The lasers are controlled in micromanager at this point. We have done some initial test with multi laser acquisitions but have not succeeded yet. We are planning to control the laser modules through TTL using NI interface but that will not be tested until later this year.

Hi Fredrik,

are you operating the lighthub with MicroManager / Open SPIM plugin?
I also have an Omicron LightHub-4 with currently only 2 lasers, but the Openspim plugin is not recognizing any of the lasers. Do you have any idea how to get it working?
… In MM the lasers are visible.

Thanks in advance,

Andreas

Dear All,

I am very new to OpenSPIM and do not have previous experience with regards to coding or ImageJ so I do apologise for all the basic questions.

I have managed to take some practise stack image stacks at 6 angles (300 images - ~2-4GB) but they do not open normally in Image J and the program just says this:

Reading heading file header (Bio-Formats Import Options listing all series), Cancelling thumbnail generation, Import preparations complete - which is followed by nothing.

When I tried pre-processing the images using the macro I used the following adaptions to the code as I only have 1 time-point:

for ( t = 1; t <= 1; t++ ) {
    for ( a = 0; a <= 5; a++ )

As I have Windows 7 64bit, I changed the directory to this:
open("E:\\SPIM_Images\\<file:///\\E:\SPIM_Images\>....spim_TL"

I also attached an exception message I received when trying to process the files.

I must be doing something very wrong and would greatly appreciate any help.

Thank you very much,

Dylan

It appears as if the time lapse might have been interrupted (but this is 
just a wild guess).

You could try to open the files individually by using 
File>Import>Bio-Formats and then adjusting the setting so that it does 
*not* group the images.

Ciao,

Hi Johannes,

Thank you for your email. I changed the settings to open the files without any prompts but it still seems to bring up all the different stacks every time I try to open a file or convert the file types. The files are actually converting now but they are taking >3 hours each and sometimes an error pops up telling me the file type incompatible and will not convert at all.

The macro only converts one at a time too, can it convert them all at once? Whenever I type in 'setBatchMode( true )' I get the attached error.

Furthermore, I also get this warning quite often: 'Could not get charToByteConverterClass!' Any idea what this is?

Thanks again,

Dylan

Subject: [OpenSPIM] storage strategies for SPIM datasets?
Message-ID: <D6DEE6AE-7157-442D-9864-6E0F26F94F4C@uni-koeln.de>

Dear all,

our SPIM (which in fact is an mDSLM) is up and running -wonderful.

This also means that we're producing a lot of data very quickly (typically about 500GB per time lapse recording, about one recording per week). In an attempt to streamline our data analysis and storage workflow, I wondered what your experiences are.

I currently just dump our data on our two 13.5TB NAS servers (a second set of NAS servers is used as a backup). Whenever I want to analyse a dataset, I first copy it to the 5TB internal hd of a reasonably powerful workstation, as reading/writing is often the limiting step for most analysis procedures. After cropping, making Z-projections, 3D registration/fusion etc I copy the results back to subfolders of the original data on the NAS server, creating an ever-growing swamp of data. Until I've finally convinced myself that it's ok to delete the raw data:-)

This "workflow" has worked for me reasonably well, but it is rather difficult to keep an overview of all the data and I just know I'm occupying much more storage space than strictly necessary to answer our biological questions. So I'm investigating the possibilities for setting up a relational database to at least keep track of all the metadata, analyses performed etc. Ideally, such a database would include thumbnails of the imaging data and allow for easy import of metadata. Any ideas? Of course not very "open", but I'm tempted to use Filemaker Pro. Anything else seems like re-inventing the OMERO wheel. Does any one have experience with using OMERO for storing all data from large SPIM datasets? Or would you just store projections and keep the raw data somewhere else? Any ideas appreciated!

cheers,
Maarten

Hi Maarten, 

We ran into a similar dilemma with large volume data from a
spectral-detecting confocal.  Ultimately you either need to invest in an
enterprise-scale storage server or you have to redefine what Œraw¹ data
means.  We concluded that our spectral deconvolution algorithms were
pretty well optimized and unlikely to be revisited soon, so we archived
the three/four/five-channel spectrally deconvolved datasets as the Œraw¹
file and did not keep the 300 GB+ 32-channel original.  Friends who work
with X-ray data from free electron lasers face the same dilemma since a
single Œraw¹ dataset can add up to 100+ TBs.  The key is to work out how
confident you feel about your processing steps.  If you are likely to
revisit your alignment/cropping protocol then keep the raw data, at least
on platter drives in a closet.  Either way I recommend managing processed
files with OMERO.  I am a big fan of that software and very grateful to
the OME group for making it.

Best,

Message-ID: <5588ACFE.4050403@emory.edu>

Hi All, I hope the science is treating you well.

I'm just in the beginning phase of setting up a SPIM unit and wondered
if anybody had any recommendations on laser power.  The website says
"necessary for experiments", but I'm not sure how that translates.  I'm
planning on using it for multiple purposes as part of a core facility on
things such as embryogenesis and cellular spheroids.

I was looking at either the 488 Stradus or LuxX based on cost, and just
wondered if anybody has tried them, what powers they have used, and how
well they worked.

Thanks
Neil

I have the 488 Stradus and use it from 1-5mW--mostly I use 1mW. The laser
power control slider in the Openspim plugin window does not control the
laser power, but I can control it from micromanager.

Hi All,

We are currently imaging large volumes that require us to acquire multiple stacks of the same angle.
Is there currently a best way to stitch images acquired OpenSPIM?
Should we use the grid/collection stitching plugin or is there a better way to go about it?

Thanks,

Gabriel

Dear Gabriel,

Yes, stitching should work. This is how the zebrafish example was assembled:

Hi Gabriel,

I was struggling a bit with the stitching step. In the end what worked 
for me is:
first convert to tif using modified script from here:
http://openspim.org/Pre-processing

then use Grid&collection stitching with settings: type=[Grid: 
column-by-column] order=[Down & Right]

It seems stupid to convert images to tiff and lose the metadata 
contained in ome, but I get errors otherwise. :/ If anybody has a better 
procedure, maybe they could describe it?

Regards,
Monika

Hi,

I noticed the following: when the TOTAL about of data (not a single 
stack, but the whole series) to be collected is large (>4 GB I think), a 
following line appears in the fiji console: "Switching to BigTIFF (by 
file size)" and then the files behave differently. For example, 
sometimes I have the behavious that Dylan described: the last displayed 
message in the Fiji status bar is "Import preparations complete", but no 
image ever appears. If the total amount of data is smaller, I have no 
problems opening files. So the BigTIFF behaviour is somehow different. 
But I thought BigTIFF should be only used if one file and not the whole 
series are >4GB...?

By the way, I also get now and then the 'Could not get 
charToByteConverterClass!', also coming from Fiji.

I realize that these are not really OpenSPIM problems, but I'm not sure 
where to look/how to understand it better.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Gabriel,

Among the open source options I have had great results with the TeraStitcher plugin for Vaa3d.  See my message about it in another forum here:

Hi Timothy,

I heard about TeraStitcher and I tried to use it on my SPIM data, but I 
got stuck. TeraStitcher expects a certain format of data, OpenSPIM data 
is quite different, so either the data has to be converted or 
TeraStitcher settings changed, but I failed at it. Could you describe in 
more detail how you do it? You mention a "cheat sheet" in the other 
message.

Monika

Hi Monika,

Yeah, terastitcher requires file naming convention that are a real pain in the rear. You need to find a bulk file renaming app or you will go crazy. It literally took us over a week to figure it out. The trick is you need to 'prime' the alignment by working out roughly where your columns sit relative to each other in XYZ coordinate space. In other words the program offloads the hardest part of alignment to the best pattern recognition out there, which is you. ImageJ was useful for estimating overlap and misalignment in Z.  

I am away from my desk but I will post a dropbox link to the list as soon as I can. 

Best,


Timothy Feinstein, Ph.D.

Hi folks, 

As promised, here is a quick cheat sheet to terastitcher, at least the version that we used about a year ago.  

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z3kx6etqsn4bn56/AAAzv5boNf0zSh6i0kgp5I_ca?dl=0

The larger file shows a set of 9x9 image stacks, 1000x1000 pixels at 10 um per pixel and a z step of 50 microns (not a real experiment).  The other file is a screen shot of the folder hierarchy that we would make from it.  The first hierarchical level of folders is named for the Y-coordinate top left pixel position (in calibrated units, e.g. nm) of columns 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., 000000, 008000 and 016000 microns).  You have to use six digits for each number.  

The next hierarchy of folders is named for the parent folder _underscore_ the X-coordinate of the top left pixel in each column extending to the right from the column for which the parent folder is named.  These units take into account overlap, so if each volume overlaps with neighboring volumes by 100 microns then the origin of each subsequent volume will be spaced 800 pixels apart rather than 1000.  You can estimate the overlap based on machine settings, but we found that column spacing was not always regular, and got better results by estimating X and Y overlap in ImageJ for each set of neighboring stacks.  

Now for the hard part.  The last hierarchy is the image files.  These are named after the parent folder _underscore_ the Z position of each slice in calibrated units.   The Z position is absolute - this means you have estimate how every stack relates to the first or highest stack, whose top slice is at Z position 0.  The first slice of every other stack will start at a different positive integer.  We measured the Z misalignment by scrolling through neighboring stacks in ImageJ to see where they lined up.  You have to relate the starting position of each stack to its neighbor and so on until all of them exist in the same coordinate space as the highest stack.  Then you can name your files.  Like I said you basically can't do this without a bulk file naming utility.  
	
Having done the hard part yourself, Terastitcher then performs non-rigid alignment to give you one single stitched file.  The alignment itself is remarkably fast, even on computers with non-ludicrous processors and RAM.  

I might have exaggerated a bit when I say we worked it out in a week.  I think it was more like two weeks.  Naturally we started with an experiment where the sample must have touched the objective a little so overlap in X, Y and Z was all over the place.  When stack acquisitions go more smoothly you can sometimes get away with assuming one overlap value across the board.  

Hope this helps!

All the best,

Dear all,

I wanted to know if anyone would have experience with any alternative to agarose or FEP tube for embedding and imaging samples?
I am currently thinking of using Gelrite, but any suggestion would be more than welcome.

Thanks!

Hi Arnaud,

I've never used it with OpenSPIM, or on a lightsheet system having a
similar design for mounting, but CyGel or CyGel Sustain from BioStatus
might work.  It offers improved optical clarity over agarose.  Also, it is
a liquid at cold and becomes a solid at room temperature or higher, making
it easy to recover live samples.  Its main drawback is cost but otherwise I
really liked it when I tried it on a confocal and on a lattice lightsheet
with live squid embryos and hatchlings.

I'd be curious to know how it goes, if you or others give it a try - or
have tried it.

Good luck!

Hi Arnaud,

I was planning to also try various tubing materials in the future. This paper has a nice comparison of a few different capillary types which you might want to have a look at.

Good luck!

Dylan

Hi Arnaud,

I've never used it with OpenSPIM, or on a lightsheet system having a similar design for mounting, but CyGel or CyGel Sustain from BioStatus might work.  It offers improved optical clarity over agarose.  Also, it is a liquid at cold and becomes a solid at room temperature or higher, making it easy to recover live samples.  Its main drawback is cost but otherwise I really liked it when I tried it on a confocal and on a lattice lightsheet with live squid embryos and hatchlings.

I'd be curious to know how it goes, if you or others give it a try - or have tried it.

Good luck!

I am currently thinking of using Gelrite, but any suggestion would be more than welcome.

Thanks!
