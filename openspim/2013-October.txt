Howdy Johannes,

I'll see what file formats I can save the plans into. Then I'll upload
them as soon as I can.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] SPIM with no laser control
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8ZhOYksVghd+do7=Ta4D7Bjxu3PfyoZwYha5A8GgbQ8ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I guess now is a good time to mention that I built my SPIM using a laser
line we already had instead of purchasing the Coherent Cube, by diverting
the existing line to the SPIM with a flip mirror and a periscope.  Laser
power control is manual. The fact that I have no laser connected is causing
a problem for SPIM acquisition, though.  I get an error message that my
setup is invalid when I first start the plugin; then, although acquisition
through the Video tab works OK, I can't acquire a regular stack or
timelapse: I get "Error acquiring: null" when I push the Oh Snap button.  I
need to change the plugin so that it ignores the laser power control, and
uses a Thorlabs shutter for blinking instead of the laser.  I realize this
might be a tall order, so I'm ready to start working on it myself, but I
would appreciate being pointed in the right direction for how to do this
most efficiently.

Thanks again,
Aurelia

Hi!

about CAD:
1. OpenSOurce formats are nice, but I'm not sure whether the 
professional CAD programs can load them.
2. Autodesk has a university program, where you can download a free full 
(in the sense of really everything except Maya) version of all their 
programs, as long as you have an e-mail-adress of a university or are 
associated to one. For me that worked nicely with my adress from 
university of Heidelberg, but also with adresses from the german cancer 
research center (just said that it's a non-profit research institute). 
So this is an easy way to get a professional CAD (Autodesk Inventor) 
without paying, but with all the features ;-) If anybody is interested. 
Here's the link:

    http://students.autodesk.com/

So could you do any of the Autocad Inventor formats, or one of the 
formats, most companies provide on their homepages (e.g. STEP, IGES, DXF 
- but that's not 3D), as most CAD programs should be able to read that.

Best from Heidelberg,
JAN

STEP files are the way to go. All the parts on openspim.org are already available in STEP format so it would also be consistent.

Hey Micahel,

This is true, however I am unsure as to which version to use. There are
two main formats, do you have any info as to which is better that I do
not?!

Hi Edgar,

I found the perfusion system more flexible and easier to handle. You can quickly exchange medium (as you mentioned) but also use it just for heating.

Regarding the Aluminum, it's the same reason why people avoid putting Aluminum wheels on their cars during winter time, when salt is used to melt down the ice. The salt in combination with water will form a nasty layer of something on the Aluminum, don't ask me for the details. We saw the very same effect in a chamber made of Aluminum that was filled with PBS.

Best,
Michael

 Hi Michael,

Thanks for your answer.

I didn't know that the perfusion system was able to control the temperature as well, sounds interesting.
Anyway my approach is to control the temperature using a PT100 sensor and a PID controller.
I already asked in the workshop and they can made the chamber out of Stainless Steel, so I won't have
oxidizing/contamination problems.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

yes, the perfusion system has a peltier element for temperature control of the medium. I also have a PT100 sensor in the chamber and a PID controller in the system, but don't ask me about technical details, that was done by the workshop. What I like is that the controller has a RS232 connector and I can regulate and monitor everything via the computer, it's useful to record the temperature in parallel to the image acquisition.

Best,
Michael

Aurelia,

Is the ThorLabs shutter set as the default shutter for your setup? (i.e. does it respond to Micro-Manager's auto-shutter functionality?) This is specified during hardware configuration. If so, please attach a core log (any should do, as long as you got the 'setup is invalid' warning) -- the SPIM device manager should be trying to use it as a laser; if this isn't happening, an exception may be appearing in the core log. If the issue is as simple as this, I may be able to fix it with minimal work, which is arguably preferable to the alternative.


The alternative: Although the ThorLabs shutter *should* be supported as a 'generic laser', it is possible to specifically add support for the device, though it requires some Java programming. If you're already familiar with our development environment (see?http://openspim.org/How_to_build_the_software?-- fair warning: setting up the development environment can take some time), the place to start is plugins/SPIMAcquisition/src/main/java/; in here are various files like PicardStage.java and CoherentCube.java. I recommend reading the top of PicardStage.java for an explanation of the block at the top of the class, then copying and renaming CoherentCube.java to i.e. ThorLabsShutter.java. Rename the contained class and change the string "CoherentCube" to the appropriate device name -- according to the device adapter source code in DeviceAdapters/ThorlabsSC10/, the right string is "SC10" -- and change the rest of the functions however you see fit.


Thanks,
Luke

Laser power control is manual. The fact that I have no laser connected is causing a problem for SPIM acquisition, though. I get an error message that my setup is invalid when I first start the plugin; then, although acquisition through the Video tab works OK, I can&#39;t acquire a regular stack or timelapse: I get "Error acquiring: null" when I push the Oh Snap button. I need to change the plugin so that it ignores the laser power control, and uses a Thorlabs shutter for blinking instead of the laser. I realize this might be a tall order, so I&#39;m ready to start working on it myself, but I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction for how to do this most efficiently.

I believe Johannes is correct, and synchronizing with Micro-Manager may resolve this issue. I&#39;ve started work on this, but the process is (frustratingly) intricate, and might take some time. In the future I hope to make the process unnecessary.

If you decide to try this, please let me know how it works out.

Hi Luke,
Now that I have added the Thorlabs shutter to the configuration as the
default shutter, I don't get the error message about the configuration
being invalid, and the OpenSPIM window never opens at all.  A corelog is
attached in case it's helpful.
I had a problem with the development environment self-installer - it seems
upset that I don't have Visual Studio 2008 (I have 2010; a screen grab of
the error message is attached) but it looks as though all the source files
ended up where they should be anyway, so I'll start having a look.
Thank you again!
Aurelia

I fear we failed to provide a new installer after switching to 2010. The
problem is a chicken-and-egg one: the installer *does* get the newest
source code (including the script that verifies what is installed), but it
does so using a *previous* script (that does not know about 2010).

Could you just run the "msys.bat" again? It should have gotten the newest
version in the previous run and use that from now on.

Ciao,
Johannes

Please look at the end of said core log. In the line above that
stacktrace, it suggests that "the user has the camera open already"? Is
it possible that another uManager instance is still running?

Ciao,

Yes, but how do I run it again, and where can I find it?  I tried running
the installer again, and I tried building Micromanager again from the
git-bash file in the development environment folder, but I got the same
error both times.

Please look at the end of said core log. In the line above that
stacktrace, it suggests that "the user has the camera open already"? Is
it possible that another uManager instance is still running?

This is pretty strange. This morning I got the same message in the log
about the camera being open already, but I have made absolutely certain
that there was not another instance running.  I then tried Live view and
Snap, which both work correctly. After this I tried to open the SPIM plugin
again, and there is still no response, but I don't get the message about
the camera being open anymore.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] All C++ developers: Transition to Visual Studio 2010
Message-ID: <CAKGYTBnwqOGKROnRFgmmtjKX+Vh0TZL4X1k53DwJfKYKLUHOfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Micro-Manager's Windows build is soon to make a long overdue switch from Visual
Studio 2008 SP1 to Visual Studio 2010 SP1.

This should not affect most users (but help with testing will be much
appreciated).

If you are a device adapter developer on Windows, or otherwise build
Micro-Manager from source on Windows, you will need to switch to VS2010 SP1
(referred to simply as VS2010 below) at the time when the switch to VS2010 is
committed to teh SVN repository.

Currently, I have a private branch of MM building with VS2010. The VS2010
branch is maintained so that it is based off a recent head of the SVN trunk.
I plan to merge this branch with the trunk, if nothing goes wrong, on

  Thursday, October 10.

The nightly builds will also switch to using VS2010 at that time.

The consequence of the merge will be that all VS2008 project files (.vcproj)
will be removed and corresponding VS2010 project files (.vcxproj) will be
added. In addition, various changes will be made to allow MM to build with
VS2010.


What you need to do
===================

## All developers building C++ components

You will need to set up VS2010. Here are the instructions (if you are using the
free Express edition):

1. Install Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
(If the installer fails, go to Control Panels > Programs and Features,
uninstall everything with "Microsoft Visual ... 2010" in its name, and try
again. An incomplete installation can seem to work but later cause subtle build
issues.)

2. Install Visual C++ 2010 Express from
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express
(Refuse the invitation to choose Visual Studio 2012.)

3. Upgrade to Visual Studio 2010 (Express) SP1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691

4. Install this package to repair VS2010 SP1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422

VS2010 can coexist with VS2008 on the same computer.


## Authors and maintainers of device adapters in the SVN repository

- I have ensured that all device adapters compile properly. Since I am unable
  to test most of the hardware, there remains the possibility of library
  incompatibilities at runtime, for device adapters that link to external
  libraries.

- Before the switch date, please download the VS2010 branch build (see below
  for a link to the installers) and test if your device adapter functions
  correctly.

- If fixes are necessary, please do not commit them to SVN before I merge the
  VS2010 branch (unless they are source code fixes that are also compatible
  with VS2008). Instead, please let me know by email.

- When I merge the VS2010 branch, there will be some changes to the project
  files in addition to simply converting from VS2008 to VS2010. Most of those
  changes have to do with centralizing project settings using Visual Studio
  property sheets (.props files). Please be aware of this (details are outlined
  in the next section). Further changes to make the build more maintainable
  will likely be made following the switch to VS2010 on the trunk, so please
  remember to run 'svn update' frequently.

- After I merge the VS2010 branch, please be careful not to commit VS2008
  project files to the repository.

If you keep your own version of the project file, please also see the next
section (but it would be best if you start over with the version in the VS2010
branch, and reapply any necessary local settings, such as library paths).


## Authors of device adapters _not_ in the SVN repository

To continue to build your adapter using the SVN trunk source code after the
VS2010 changes are merged, you will need to:

- Open your .vcproj file in VS2010 and click through the wizard to convert it
  to a .vcxproj file.

- In Project Properties > General, set 'Platform Toolset' to 'Windows7.1SDK'
  (make sure to set this for all Configurations and all Platforms).

- In Project Properties > Linker > General, reset 'Output File' to '<inherit
  from parent or project defaults>' (for all Configurations and Platforms).

- In Tools > Settings, choose 'Export Settings'.

- Open View > Property Manager. For each Configuration/Platform, right-click
  and choose 'Add Existing Property Sheet...'. Choose the
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMCommon.props file in the MM source (only
  available in the VS2010 branch).

- Repeat the previous step, this time to add
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMDeviceAdapter.props. When you're done, make sure
  that MMDeviceAdapter is displayed above MMCommon, at the top the list.

- Go back to View > Solution Explorer and once again open the project
  properties. Reset all of the following properties to '<inherit from parent or
  project defaults>' (make sure to first select all Configurations and all
  Platforms):

  - General > Output Directory
  - General > Intermediate Directory
  - General > Target Name
  - C/C++ > General > Warning Level
  - Linker > Debugging > Generate Debug Info
  - Linker > Advanced > Randomized Base Address
  - Everything under Build Events (there is no longer a need to have a copy
    command here), unless you have special requirements.

  These settings are now set in the common property sheets so that they don't
  have to be set for each device adapter. (We will likely move more settings to
  the property sheets in the future.)

If you prefer, you can test your VS2010 project file ahead of time using the
source code from my private VS2010 branch (see below for downloading).


## Developers who perform full or partial builds of Micro-Manager on Windows

Previously, there were a few Visual Studio solution (.sln) files scattered
around the source tree, and MMCoreJ_wrap/MMCoreJ_wrap.sln contained all device
adapters in addition to the Core and MMCoreJ. Built binaries were placed in
the directories bin_Win32/ and bin_x64/.

With the update to VS2010, there is a single solution file (micromanager.sln at
the source root) that is used to build all C++ components (Core, MMCoreJ,
MMCorePy, device adapters, and the not-very-well-maintained test projects).
Built binaries are placed in build/Release/Win32/ (or the corresponding
directory for the selected configuration and platform).

The fastest way to build several projects (e.g. the Core, MMCoreJ, and a
handful of device adapters) is to open micromanager.sln, right click each
project, and choose 'Build'.


Downloading the VS2010 branch
=============================

The source code, patch set, and binary installers for the VS2010 branch are
available here:
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~mtsuchida/ephemeral/expires-20131031/vs2010/

Once the VS2010 branch is merged into the SVN trunk (currently sceduled for Oct
10), this page will be removed.

Maintainers of closed-source device adapters can contact me directly to get a
copy of the patched source code (the installers include closed-source device
adapters).

I will periodically update the VS2010 branch to incorporate changes to the SVN
trunk.


Q & A
=====

Q: I tested a device adapter from the installer linked above, and it doesn't
   work. How sould I report this?
A: Please first make sure it is working with the VS2008 build (i.e. the current
   nightly build). If it is, please post to this mailing list and include the
   symptoms you observe when you try to add the device in the Hardware
   Configuration Wizard. Please also include the relevant contents of the
   CoreLog (with debug logging enabled). I will work with you to fix the issues.

Q: How do I build MMCoreJ.jar on the VS2010 branch?
A: One additional change has been made to MMCoreJ: the generated Java code is
   compiled by the Ant scripts (i.e. the same way all the other Java components
   are built), instead of invoking the Java compiler from Visual Studio. If you
   want to build just MMCoreJ.jar, after building MMCoreJ_wrap from VS2010, run
   the following command from the command prompt, in the MM source root (Apache
   Ant is required):
   ant -f MMCoreJ_wrap\build.xml

Q: How do I build LibraryTest?
A: Open micromanager.sln, select the Platform, and right-click LibraryTest, and
   choose 'Build'. The output can be found at e.g.
   build/Release/Win32/LibraryTest.exe

Q: Why not keep both .vcproj and .vcxproj in the SVN trunk, so that either
   VS2008 or VS2010 can be used?
A: I'm sorry, but that would be too much of a maintainance nightmare....

Q: Why not switch to VS2012?
A: We hope to do so eventually, and the switch from VS2010 should be relatively
   easy (compared to VS2008 -> VS2010). Just want to take things one step at a
   time. Also, I think it will be relatively easy to build with VS2012 using
   VS2010 project files, as the changes are not as drastic as between VS2008
   and VS2010.


Thanks for bearing with all that.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
Mark

Cool, good info to know.
Can you please tell me if I need Professional, Premium, etc. and/or if 
the MSDN is needed?
Also, would be worth going straight for 2012 if it's backward compatible?
Thanks
Neil

When you run the installer, it asks you where you want to install the
development environment, defaulting to C:\OpenSPIM-dev-env. That is where
the msys.bat lives.

Okay, then our build system does not work... I will have to defer that to
Luke because I am too short on time, preparing for a one-week work trip.

Hmm. I run out of ideas... :-(

Hi Aurelia,

The build error isn't exactly a chicken and egg problem, but a matter of dependencies: when Micro-Manager is built on VS2010, people without the 2010 runtime can't run it. I recently ran into this problem, and assuming 2010 was backwards-compatible, changed MM to build in 2008 mode. Hence your error; I expect anyone with only VS2010 installed will experience a similar issue.

A possible fix is to use VS2010 to open the solution file, right click on the MMCoreJ project and click properties, and change the Platform Toolset to v100 (I don't recall exactly where the option is; sorry!). You may need to change this for other projects as well, but then the build script should work.

After next week Thursday I should be able to provide a more permanent fix, since Micro-Manager will officially upgrade to VS2010. (The missing files that started all this will be packaged with Micro-Manager, so I only need to resynchronize our code to get all the benefits.).

Regarding the error you're getting, I truly have no idea. I should point out that this is technically progress over the ThorLabs problem; the plugin doesn't try to create a pixel size configuration until it verifies the setup is correct. When it does try, however, it seems to cause an error in the camera device. I can't trace the error yet; if you get the project building, you might check the file/line the core log mentions for clues. I may be able to help further on Monday.

A possible workaround would be to launch Micro-Manager, create a pixel size configuration manually -- as long as it's positive, the plugin shouldn't try to create a new one, and so may avoid this issue.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you come up with anything.
Luke

For the Core and the vast majority of device adapters, Express (with
SDK 7.1 and VS2010 SP1) should be sufficient.

> Also, would be worth going straight for 2012 if it's backward compatible?

I'm hoping upgrading to VS2012 will be much easier, and it will be
nice to do it before we get 3 years behind.

It looks like VS2010 SP1 project files will work in VS2012 without
conversion if VS2010 SP1 is installed on the same computer (presumably
using the VS2010 libraries and compilers)
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh690665.aspx).
However, normal Visual C++ 2012 project files will probably not work
with VS2010.

Most of the work in upgrading to 2010 was in getting our ~140 device
adapters to build correctly. I don't (yet) know what to expect for the
various third-party libraries when building with 2012 (just haven't
tried yet).

Best,
Mark

Sorry, I think I got the wrong reply emails somehow.  Here's what I sent 
to Michael Weber only:

Hi all, thanks for the numerous replies.

I have the .step files from the wiki, and in fact I used MeshLab 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeshLab) to convert them to .dxf files to 
give to my machine shop guy.

My request is that of a complete unit, in it's functional form, i.e. all 
the CAD files in one window.  I think it would be a useful asset to have 
available for those just starting the process.  I am thinking about the 
options of multi-color and other extensions and I wanted to know how 
much extra breadboard I might need, and how much space I have in various 
places.

I would be ok with any file type that included everything. SolidWorks 
would works if it's versions 2003 to 2010...  These files go straight 
into AutoCAD:
     *.prt, *.sldprt (part) - versions 2003 - 2010
     *.asm, *.sldasm (assembly) - versions 2003 -2010
Obviously AutoCAD files .dwg, .dxf would be cool too as I have the 
student version of AutoCAD from my graduate studies.

In the spirit of Open Source, Blender has an option to import VRML 1.0 
files exported from SolidWorks 
(http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Tutorials/Render/Import/SolidWorks). 
I haven't had any experience with this, but it might be a good place to 
keep things easy access for rendering.  Blender also .3ds files, so 
exporting from AutoCAD or 3dsMax to .3ds would also keep things open.  
.stl files are also an option, see here: 
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Data_System/Files/Import

I'm not sure if there's a 'Blender' of the CAD world, so to speak, so I 
can't comment in that direction.  Be nice to know if there were.

If anybody has such a complete file, in nearly any of the aforementioned 
(don't you just love it when you get a chance to slip words like that in 
here and there) file types, please feel free to send me a link (be nice 
to get it on the wiki too).

Thanks in advance for your time.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] SPIM with no laser control
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8ZXM5nAyhh56rb5Rva-8vcxfBEi8ANav4mE5H70TnwNJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Doing a manual pixel size calibration before opening the camera has in fact
solved the problem!  I'm now able to acquire stacks, with the Thorlabs
shutter acting in place of the laser.  Fantastic!  Thank you!
I wasn't able to change the platform toolset in the MMCoreJ solution file;
it seems to be something one can only change in the project file.  This is
not urgent for me anymore though, so if the general MicroManager upgrade
will solve the build problem then that's great.
Thanks for all your help, I am looking forward very much  to starting data
collection!

Aurelia

Hi Edgar,

Nothing in this thread dump seems to me to indicate a dead lock of any kind -- however, I suspect the issue with 'insert stack at this Z plus' is being caused by an exception being thrown and not being presented to the user interface. Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.


Thanks,
Luke

Subject: [OpenSPIM] First SPIM image! and new acquisition problem: writing
	to disk
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8acqWbGg_kfjOXZ=rvapfLUw5k2apr4R4JhDC54Pbp_Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry, I have been asking a lot of questions lately, but I have at least
one more today.  I can now acquire a stack, but only if I leave the Output
directory field blank (I attach a projection of my first SPIM image, which
I'm very happy about). If I put in a directory, then when I push Snap
nothing happens.  It doesn't seem to matter which folder I use, and there's
no entry in the core log.  If it's a non-empty directory, I do get a
message warning me that any OME-tiff files will be deleted, but after I
dismiss the message nothing happens once more.  Has anyone had a problem
like this before?  Could it be Windows 7 related?

Thanks again,

Aurelia

Hi Luke,

I attach a corelog that was just made. In the OpenSPIM.app folder also appears a .log file named hs_err_pid5456, maybe
could be helpful as well. I have to point out that I am not controlling the laser using the plugin (the laser I am using
is not supported by MicroManager) so as happen with Aurelia a message is shown saying that my setup appears to be invalid
before executing the acquire SPIM image plugin.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Nothing in this thread dump seems to me to indicate a dead lock of any kind -- however, I suspect the issue with 'insert stack at this Z plus' is being caused by an exception being thrown and not being presented to the user interface. Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.


Thanks,
Luke

There is really no reason to be sorry about that. Scientists have a track
record of lacking the desire to communicate effectively, so I enjoy very
much that you are an exception!

This is a really awesome picture! Would you mind uploading it to the wiki
and adding it to the gallery? I can help you with that should there be any
problems.

Could you copy the ImageJ-win32.exe in OpenSPIM.app/ and rename the copied
file to debug.exe and run that? This should give you a console output (I
strongly suspect an exception to occur, which I would be really eager to
see, maybe you could copy/paste it into a reply?).

It is probably the same issue in that case.

> Has anyone had a problem like this before?  Could it be Windows 7 related?

Quite possibly. But I can only guess without having a glimpse at the
console output.

Ciao,
Johannes

I have updated the patch set and installers (available from the same
link). The VS2010 test build now includes changes on the SVN trunk up
to yesterday (20131008 PDT).

I have also added a patch (22/22) that renames the Visual Studio
project files for some of the device adapters, where the name did not
match the name of the device adapter (the device adapter name is
generated from the project name in the Visual Studio solution used to
build, which, confusingly, can differ from the project filename). This
is a good opportunity to eliminate the inconsistency, since the
filenames are changing anyway (from .vcproj to .vcxproj). The
directory names containing the device adapter projects are also often
inconsistent with the project name and adapter name, but I'm leaving
this unchanged to prevent confusion (and repository administration
complexities).

All this will be merged to the trunk tomorrow (Oct 10). We may briefly
disable write access to the repository during the merge; progress will
be posted here.

Best,
Mark

Hello,

Thanks!  I'm glad you are enjoying my constant questions.

I have added the Volvox picture to the gallery on the wiki, and also added
my lab to the "who has an OpenSPIM" page.

There is in fact an exception, here is the debug console output:

This class is in my jars/loci-common-4.4.8.jar... Could you call
Help>Update Fiji, switch to the advanced mode, select the view mode "View
all files", type "loci-common" in the search box and see whether yours is
up-to-date?

Hi Edgar,

This core log seems incomplete -- I'm guessing the output was buffered (not written to disk) and got lost somehow; did you close MM before attaching the file?


If you're getting an invalid setup warning (because of a missing laser), that is almost certainly the cause; the acquisition process attempts to directly control the 'laser' at various points, which would cause null pointer exceptions if no laser was found. If you have no MM-compatible shutter attached, one temporary workaround might be to add the DemoShutter -- this object does nothing of significance when it is controlled, but it should trick the plugin into believing the setup is complete. In hardware setup, just add DemoCamera/DHub and select only the DemoShutter peripheral. Then on the final page be sure it is set as your default shutter.


The ideal permanent solution would be to obtain a device adapter for your laser so that the plugin *can* control it -- perhaps we could contact the manufacturer and suggest it to them, as they would know best how to interact with the laser hardware. On the other hand, the plugin should probably be prepared for the absence of a laser; I'll look into this as time permits, though through the next week or so I will probably have my hands full with source code management.


Thanks,
Luke

Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.

Thanks very much for doing that. That's the spirit! Am I the only one here who recognised this as Volvox ;-). I assume its autofluorescence. Very nice sample.

All the best

Hi again,
In fact, loci-common was completely missing.  I then looked at my update
sites, and for some reason only the ImageJ site was checked, the Fiji and
OpenSPIM ones were not.  This is odd because I remember confirming that
they were active earlier, when I first installed everything.  Checking them
and then updating has made writing to disk during acquisition work, so I am
delighted.  I am also beginning to dimly sense the lesson that whenever
things don't work I should always double-check that everything is updated
correctly...

I think I know why... :-( It is a bug in the fall-back when the updater is
not working (and it was not working recently due to unexpected changes in
http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites).

I will try to do something about that so it does not happen anymore in the
future!

Ciao,

Hi All,

The Visual Studio 2010 patches have now been committed to the SVN
trunk (r11918 through r11946). You will now need to use VS2010 to
build the head.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or difficulties.

Best,
Mark

 Hi Luke,

I did close MM before attaching the file. Now I set the demo Shutter as default shutter and no longer
receive the message of setup invalid. But the problem of the Z stack button remains.

I just discovered something: when I open the SPIMage plugin and move the stage, snap, add position to the list, etc..
after closing MicroManager/Fiji any error file appears in the OpenSPIM.app folder but as long as I press the Stack at this Z plus
button a new error file appear after I close MicroManager/Fiji. Maybe in the error file is the clue.

I attach the new core log and the lastest error file created.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

This core log seems incomplete -- I'm guessing the output was buffered (not written to disk) and got lost somehow; did you close MM before attaching the file?


If you're getting an invalid setup warning (because of a missing laser), that is almost certainly the cause; the acquisition process attempts to directly control the 'laser' at various points, which would cause null pointer exceptions if no laser was found. If you have no MM-compatible shutter attached, one temporary workaround might be to add the DemoShutter -- this object does nothing of significance when it is controlled, but it should trick the plugin into believing the setup is complete. In hardware setup, just add DemoCamera/DHub and select only the DemoShutter peripheral. Then on the final page be sure it is set as your default shutter.


The ideal permanent solution would be to obtain a device adapter for your laser so that the plugin *can* control it -- perhaps we could contact the manufacturer and suggest it to them, as they would know best how to interact with the laser hardware. On the other hand, the plugin should probably be prepared for the absence of a laser; I'll look into this as time permits, though through the next week or so I will probably have my hands full with source code management.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Angela et al:

As I've mentioned on the OpenSPIM mailing list, I'm currently in the process of synchronizing our version of Micro-Manager with the latest source code changes (to pull in the VS2012 updates and new build process). Thankfully, this is nearly complete; I expect to be finished in a few days. At that point, I'll update the version of the code we have on our Fiji update site; if you're using the OpenSPIM package (downloaded from our wiki), you should only need to update Fiji to get the latest version of Micro-Manager and the PicardStage adapter.


Once that's complete, I'm hoping to simplify our source code quite a bit, so we can submit our device adapter to the Micro-Manager repository as Nico suggested; this way the device adapter will be included in the new builds of Micro-Manager, and so you'll need only download new versions of Micro-Manager as they are released. I'm hesitant to put an exact timeline on this step, but ideally it will happen within a week or two.


In the mean time, you shouldn't have any trouble using our device adapter provided through our Fiji distribution. (If you are using the 32-bit version of Micro-Manager, it may also work to copy "mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll" and "PiUsb.dll" from our mm/win32 directory to Micro-Manager's directory in Program Files.)


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

It is not in our repository and I do not think that it was ever part of a Micro-Manager distribution. You can ask them to contribute the code to the Micro-Manager repository so that it will be incorporated in future builds.

Unfortunately nothing from the authors on the wiki. I will inquire. its a process...

Ok, didn't know. That's great. I will corner him ;-).

Nice!

I added the page http://openspim.org/Publications and added their
publication to the list.

Thanks! Could you ask them to add a nice picture to

Hello everyone,

I've finished updating the plugin to use (nearly) the latest Micro-Manager base. The changes have been pushed to our update site; please be sure you update Fiji to get the latest code (This is a good idea in general, particularly if you encounter a possible issue.). I should point out that completely updating Fiji sometimes takes two or three goes before all changes have been acquired successfully; please make sure that the updater says "Your ImageJ is up to date!" at the end (or, if you're tinkering with the development environment, there will only be locally-modified files).


There is one known issue I've encountered: having the plugin auto-start with Micro-Manager causes stage controls to not function. (I suspect the startup sequence for Micro-Manager has changed, causing the startup script to run earlier than expected.) As a temporary workaround, please do not auto-start the plugin. I hope to have a fix for this tomorrow or early next week.


I also expect people using unexpected hardware may receive load errors saying the device adapter interface versions are mismatched. (This may also happen silently, causing unexpected program crashes.) If this is the case, please download the latest _non-nightly_ version of Micro-Manager and try the adapters from there. (For reference, the Hamamatsu device adapter we distribute now comes from the October 11 nightly build:?http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_32bit_1.4.16_20131011.exe -- any device adapters from that release will almost certainly work with OpenSPIM.)
N.B.: The latest nightly build has once again changed version numbers, so device adapters from that build will _not_ load in OpenSPIM -- yet. :-)


Some special notes for people using our development environment:
- You will need to "git pull" to update to the latest source code.
- Your device adapters may not show any need for updating, but their use could cause trouble -- see the above note for where to find replacements, if you aren't building them from scratch.


As always, if you encounter any problems, feel free to e-mail myself and/or the list; I'll do my best to address issues as they are raised.


Thank you,
Luke Stuyvenberg

 Hi dear All,

I have made some imaging of a zebra fish that expresses GFP fluorescence with a heat shock, I have gotten 25 stacks (5x5) and stitched it together.
2 ?m green beads were embedded? to the agarose and I think that the beads signal is good in contrast to the signal of the fish. 

I would like to know if with the concentration of beads that could be appreciated in the Z projection and the video of the scanning of the resulting stack
is enough to perform multiview fusion.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Thankfully, this is nearly complete; I expect to be finished in a few days. At that point, I'll update the version of the code we have on our Fiji update site; if you're using the OpenSPIM package (downloaded from our wiki), you should only need to update Fiji to get the latest version of Micro-Manager and the PicardStage adapter.

I'm hesitant to put an exact timeline on this step, but ideally it will happen within a week or two.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] windows crash after today's update
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8YoQxm_iJ-U2mhQVtfJ_jO1kMMSrmsbgNj+49ZeVXPRHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have developed a new software problem: after I start the OpenSPIM plugin,
I get an "ImageJ has stopped working" message from Windows, followed a few
seconds later by a blue screen with the message "Process has locked
pages."  This happens after I start the OpenSPIM plugin or if I try to
start the camera live view.  A core log follows, but I don't think it shows
anything strange.
I can avoid the crash by doing a system restore back to last week, but in
that case for some reason my camera live view malfunctions (it opens and
runs, but doesn't display the live image).
Is anyone else having this problem?

Thank you,
Aurelia

Dear Edgar,

I am not sure I understand what you did. How did you stitch them together? Is this multi-view (angle) data or a tiling across a large field of view?

In any case you most likely do not have enough beads in there. I would say you need ten times more.

Your beads are gigantic, 2um, we use much smaller beads typically.

Let me know more details and I am sure we can work it out.

All the best

PAvel

Hi Luke & OpenSPIM,

Congrats!

Do you happen to see any pattern to the undetected incompatibilities
(such as the Micro-Manager version from which the device adapters
came)? (I might want to investigate if (and probably only if) there is
a recurring pattern that looks like more than unrelated bugs or
incompatibilities with non-device-adapter DLLs. Never mind if it
appears unpredictable.)

> N.B.: The latest nightly build has once again changed version numbers, so device adapters from that build will _not_ load in OpenSPIM -- yet. :-)

In case anybody cares, the incompatibility is since October 22 (SVN
r11996) (i.e. MM nightly build device adapters from Oct 22 onward are
incompatible with Luke's present update, or with MM 1.4.15, the latest
release version).

Ironically, that incompatibility was introduced in order to prevent
crashes that could occur due to incompatible device adapters. The
problem was usually seen when using the MultiCamera device, and is
most likely to be observed when using (real) camera device adapters
that are compiled by a different version of Visual Studio.

Best,
Mark

 Dear Pavel,

The data is a tiling across a large field of view, for the stitching I used the Grid/Collection Stitching plugin from
Fiji, it works perfectly. So I will buy the 0.5 um beads that are recommended in the OpenSPIM wiki and have a greater concentration. This image was only a test with the beads that we have already available. Thanks a lot for your update.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Dear Edgar,

I am not sure I understand what you did. How did you stitch them together? Is this multi-view (angle) data or a tiling across a large field of view?

In any case you most likely do not have enough beads in there. I would say you need ten times more.

Your beads are gigantic, 2um, we use much smaller beads typically.

Let me know more details and I am sure we can work it out.

All the best

Hi Edgar,

Ok, I thought its something like that. Definitely use more beads and smaller diameter.

All the best

Subject: [OpenSPIM] "Stack at this Z plus" problem persisting

Dear Luke,

I am sorry to disturb you again but I have been struggling a lot with SPIM acquisiton plugin :(. Hopefully I made some discoveries.

I updated Fiji and again had the problem again about the TIScam (The Imaging Source camera). But I discover that 
mmgr_dal_TIScam.dll depends on TIS_DShowLib10.dll and TIS_UDSHL10.dll but in the mm\Win32 location are
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9d.dll and TIS_DShowLib09.dll. I got the version 10 of the DLLs from the 1.14.16 version of a plain 
installation of MicroManager and just copied them to mm\Win32. Maybe you can solve that from the Fiji updater: to uninstall 
the version 9 of the DLLs and to install the version 10. Anayway the problem about the camera is fixed now. I attach the
version 10 of the DLLs to this mail.

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button I still have the problem when using the updated version of Fiji. I also discover that if I don't 
use the demo shuter I can't write the images direclty to disk, the message "Error acquiring: null" appears and in the output directory is saved a .ome.tiff
empty image (0 byte). So for the moment I have to use the no updated version of Fiji in order to perform SPIM acquisiton.

The problem about using the no updated version of Fiji is that the plugin don't respond when pressing "Oh Snap" (as
it happens when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" in the Fiji updated version) when I want to write the images directly to disk.

So at the end if I want to perform SPIM image acquisition (the way I have done that until now), I have to use the no updated version 
of Fiji and save the images to RAM no specifying an ouput directory. The problem is that I am limited by the RAM and all the images
are saved in the same stack even if different positions are specified in the position list.

Finally to be sure that the problem about the "Stack at this Z plus" button is not related to the computer I am using (Windows XP 32 bit)
I tried Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bit).

I really would like to use the SPIM image acquisition plugin and benefit from all his capabilities.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Please don't worry about disturbing me; it's what I am here for, after all!

You are absolutely correct about the missing TIScam DLLs; I forgot to include them in the new version. I will head to LOCI and correct that in two hours or so.

I'm still at a loss with regards to the errors you are encountering, however. I will have a patch for the 'no laser' problem early next week, hopefully alongside the autostart fix, but until we can diagnose the acquisition bug, I won't know how to fix it.

With that in mind, I have some more information to request:
- Please attach to your reply all core logs, hs error files, and configuration files (your active one, in particular), compressed with your file archiver of choice.
- Please list a) all hardware involved in the setup (with model numbers, if you have them), and b) all devices you set up in the hardware configuration.
- When you click the 'insert stack' button, you say it sticks down and nothing happens -- is the rest of the UI still responsive? Can you change tabs? Move the stage?

I'm casting a pretty wide net, here, but hopefully somewhere in there will be a vital clue.

Thanks,
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about this. It sounds like this is a device adapter problem, most likely in the camera. If you can, please try copying the device adapters and extra DLLs from the Micro-Manager build I linked to in the update email -- it's possible either the DA or a manufacturer DLL has been upgraded.

Did the error create an error log? This would be something like hs_err_pid1234 -- if a file like this was created the same day as the crash, could you please attach it to a reply?

Thanks,
Luke

 Hi Luke,

I will send you all the information requested on monday, since now I am not at the
institute. Hopefully with the no laser patch the problem could be solved, but we have
to try first. 

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button, it is the only problem, it looks that it sticks. I can still
move the stage, change the tabs, add a new single position in the position list, use snap
images and save them in RAM or directly in disk. In resume, I can do everything except set a 
stack of positions in the position list.

Thanks to you!! and see you on monday.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Antwort: Re: "Stack at this Z plus" problem persisting

 Hi Luke,

I will send you all the information requested on monday, since now I am not at the
institute. Hopefully with the no laser patch the problem could be solved, but we have
to try first. 

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button, it is the only problem, it looks that it sticks. I can still
move the stage, change the tabs, add a new single position in the position list, use snap
images and save them in RAM or directly in disk. In resume, I can do everything except set a 
stack of positions in the position list.

Thanks to you!! and see you on monday.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Please don't worry about disturbing me; it's what I am here for, after all!

You are absolutely correct about the missing TIScam DLLs; I forgot to include them in the new version. I will head to LOCI and correct that in two hours or so.

I'm still at a loss with regards to the errors you are encountering, however. I will have a patch for the 'no laser' problem early next week, hopefully alongside the autostart fix, but until we can diagnose the acquisition bug, I won't know how to fix it.

With that in mind, I have some more information to request:
- Please attach to your reply all core logs, hs error files, and configuration files (your active one, in particular), compressed with your file archiver of choice.
- Please list a) all hardware involved in the setup (with model numbers, if you have them), and b) all devices you set up in the hardware configuration.
- When you click the 'insert stack' button, you say it sticks down and nothing happens -- is the rest of the UI still responsive? Can you change tabs? Move the stage?

I'm casting a pretty wide net, here, but hopefully somewhere in there will be a vital clue.

Thanks,
Luke

 Dear Luke,

I am sorry to disturb you again but I have been struggling a lot with SPIM acquisiton plugin :(. Hopefully I made some discoveries.
 
I updated Fiji and again had the problem again about the TIScam (The Imaging Source camera). But I discover that 
 mmgr_dal_TIScam.dll depends on TIS_DShowLib10.dll and  TIS_UDSHL10.dll but in the mm\Win32 location are
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9d.dll  and TIS_DShowLib09.dll. I got the version 10 of the DLLs from the 1.14.16 version of a plain 
 installation of MicroManager and just copied them to  mm\Win32. Maybe you can solve that from the Fiji updater: to uninstall 
 the version 9 of the DLLs and to install the version 10. Anayway the problem about the camera is fixed now. I attach the
 version 10 of the DLLs to this mail.

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button I still have the problem when using the updated version of Fiji. I also discover that if I don't 
 use the demo shuter I can't write the images direclty to disk, the message "Error acquiring: null" appears and in the output directory is saved a .ome.tiff
 empty image (0 byte). So for the moment I have to use the no updated version of Fiji in order to perform SPIM acquisiton.
 
The problem about using the no updated version of Fiji is that the plugin don't respond when pressing "Oh Snap" (as
 it happens when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" in the Fiji updated version) when I want to write the images directly to disk.
 
So at the end if I want to perform SPIM image acquisition (the way I have done that until now), I have to use the no updated version 
 of Fiji and save the images to RAM no specifying an ouput directory. The problem is that I am limited by the RAM and all the images
 are saved in the same stack even if different positions are specified in the position list.
 
Finally to be sure that the problem about the "Stack at this Z plus" button is not related to the computer I am using (Windows XP 32 bit)
 I tried Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bit).

I really would like to use the SPIM image acquisition plugin and benefit from all his capabilities.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi again,
Thanks!  The problem was the DLL file and when I changed it to the correct
one the problem was resolved.  Sorry, I should have figured this out on my
own, but for some reason, Gmail decided to put specifically the update
email into my spam folder, but not the open spim emails before or after it,
so I hadn't seen it (and didn't know it was missing).  But now everything
is working again.
Thank you,
Aurelia

Hi Edgar,

Unfortunately the files were not as revealing as I had hoped. They seem to indicate a persistent problem with either the TIScam device adapter or the way we interact with it. (Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.


When you click the 'insert stack' button, it is only that button that sticks, correct? The remaining buttons still work? You can change between tabs, move motors, et cetera? Can it be un-stuck and clicked on again? It's still possible that there is a silent exception being generated; I'll check on that.


Also, please try updating to the latest version again -- I recently pushed an update that should eliminate the need for the demo-shutter trick by being prepared for the absence of a laser.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

About the error files, you are right, they appear as long as I close  ?Manager/Fiji. The "Stack at this Z plus" button is the only problem, I  can
still made everthing else as I menctioned before. I just updated Fiji and the problem persist. The button is unstucked as long as I move the mouse
cursor outside the area of the button and I am able to click it again. The problem is comparable as if I place the cursor over a normal button e.g.
Oh Snap!, then click the mouse and move the cursor outside Oh Snap! and finally release the mouse outside Oh Snap! 
If you do that simply nothing happens. That is just the way the "Stack at this Z plus" button behaves.

I also thought that the problem was related with the TIS cam but I already test Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bits). In that computer
is not installed any driver or software from the camera. I made a test using only the Picard Stage, a demo shutter and a demo camera
and the problem about "Stack at this Z plus" remains, the only difference I noticed is that when I close ?Manager/Fiji there is no error files.

Hope this information is useful. Have a happy longweekend. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

So the issue appears regardless of operating system (Windows XP versus Windows 7) and architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit)? Did you try going back to the no-shutter configuration? (It shouldn't have a problem now that I've added some checks for an absent laser.)


I take it all the motor controls are fully functional? That is, the sliders all report the current position correctly, and let you change the position without trouble, for all four stage axes?

I've uploaded another version of the plugin which is a little more direct about its error reporting; please try updating once more -- although this may not fix the issue, it might produce useful error output.


Thanks again,
Luke

(Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.

I'll see what file formats I can save the plans into. Then I'll upload
them as soon as I can.

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8ZhOYksVghd+do7=Ta4D7Bjxu3PfyoZwYha5A8GgbQ8ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I guess now is a good time to mention that I built my SPIM using a laser
line we already had instead of purchasing the Coherent Cube, by diverting
the existing line to the SPIM with a flip mirror and a periscope.  Laser
power control is manual. The fact that I have no laser connected is causing
a problem for SPIM acquisition, though.  I get an error message that my
setup is invalid when I first start the plugin; then, although acquisition
through the Video tab works OK, I can't acquire a regular stack or
timelapse: I get "Error acquiring: null" when I push the Oh Snap button.  I
need to change the plugin so that it ignores the laser power control, and
uses a Thorlabs shutter for blinking instead of the laser.  I realize this
might be a tall order, so I'm ready to start working on it myself, but I
would appreciate being pointed in the right direction for how to do this
most efficiently.

Thanks again,
Aurelia

Hi!

about CAD:
1. OpenSOurce formats are nice, but I'm not sure whether the 
professional CAD programs can load them.
2. Autodesk has a university program, where you can download a free full 
(in the sense of really everything except Maya) version of all their 
programs, as long as you have an e-mail-adress of a university or are 
associated to one. For me that worked nicely with my adress from 
university of Heidelberg, but also with adresses from the german cancer 
research center (just said that it's a non-profit research institute). 
So this is an easy way to get a professional CAD (Autodesk Inventor) 
without paying, but with all the features ;-) If anybody is interested. 
Here's the link:

    http://students.autodesk.com/

So could you do any of the Autocad Inventor formats, or one of the 
formats, most companies provide on their homepages (e.g. STEP, IGES, DXF 
- but that's not 3D), as most CAD programs should be able to read that.

Best from Heidelberg,
JAN

STEP files are the way to go. All the parts on openspim.org are already available in STEP format so it would also be consistent.

Hey Micahel,

This is true, however I am unsure as to which version to use. There are
two main formats, do you have any info as to which is better that I do
not?!

Hi Edgar,

I found the perfusion system more flexible and easier to handle. You can quickly exchange medium (as you mentioned) but also use it just for heating.

Regarding the Aluminum, it's the same reason why people avoid putting Aluminum wheels on their cars during winter time, when salt is used to melt down the ice. The salt in combination with water will form a nasty layer of something on the Aluminum, don't ask me for the details. We saw the very same effect in a chamber made of Aluminum that was filled with PBS.

Best,
Michael

Hi Pete,

I have no idea, but the specifications have to be explained somewhere…

 Hi Michael,

Thanks for your answer.

I didn't know that the perfusion system was able to control the temperature as well, sounds interesting.
Anyway my approach is to control the temperature using a PT100 sensor and a PID controller.
I already asked in the workshop and they can made the chamber out of Stainless Steel, so I won't have
oxidizing/contamination problems.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

yes, the perfusion system has a peltier element for temperature control of the medium. I also have a PT100 sensor in the chamber and a PID controller in the system, but don't ask me about technical details, that was done by the workshop. What I like is that the controller has a RS232 connector and I can regulate and monitor everything via the computer, it's useful to record the temperature in parallel to the image acquisition.

Best,
Michael

Aurelia,

Is the ThorLabs shutter set as the default shutter for your setup? (i.e. does it respond to Micro-Manager's auto-shutter functionality?) This is specified during hardware configuration. If so, please attach a core log (any should do, as long as you got the 'setup is invalid' warning) -- the SPIM device manager should be trying to use it as a laser; if this isn't happening, an exception may be appearing in the core log. If the issue is as simple as this, I may be able to fix it with minimal work, which is arguably preferable to the alternative.


The alternative: Although the ThorLabs shutter *should* be supported as a 'generic laser', it is possible to specifically add support for the device, though it requires some Java programming. If you're already familiar with our development environment (see http://openspim.org/How_to_build_the_software -- fair warning: setting up the development environment can take some time), the place to start is plugins/SPIMAcquisition/src/main/java/; in here are various files like PicardStage.java and CoherentCube.java. I recommend reading the top of PicardStage.java for an explanation of the block at the top of the class, then copying and renaming CoherentCube.java to i.e. ThorLabsShutter.java. Rename the contained class and change the string "CoherentCube" to the appropriate device name -- according to the device adapter source code in DeviceAdapters/ThorlabsSC10/, the right string is "SC10" -- and change the rest of the functions however you see fit.


Thanks,
Luke

Laser power control is manual. The fact that I have no laser connected is causing a problem for SPIM acquisition, though. I get an error message that my setup is invalid when I first start the plugin; then, although acquisition through the Video tab works OK, I can&#39;t acquire a regular stack or timelapse: I get "Error acquiring: null" when I push the Oh Snap button.

I realize this might be a tall order, so I&#39;m ready to start working on it myself, but I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction for how to do this most efficiently.

I believe Johannes is correct, and synchronizing with Micro-Manager may resolve this issue. I&#39;ve started work on this, but the process is (frustratingly) intricate, and might take some time. In the future I hope to make the process unnecessary.

If you decide to try this, please let me know how it works out.

Hi Luke,
Now that I have added the Thorlabs shutter to the configuration as the
default shutter, I don't get the error message about the configuration
being invalid, and the OpenSPIM window never opens at all.  A corelog is
attached in case it's helpful.
I had a problem with the development environment self-installer - it seems
upset that I don't have Visual Studio 2008 (I have 2010; a screen grab of
the error message is attached) but it looks as though all the source files
ended up where they should be anyway, so I'll start having a look.
Thank you again!
Aurelia

I fear we failed to provide a new installer after switching to 2010. The
problem is a chicken-and-egg one: the installer *does* get the newest
source code (including the script that verifies what is installed), but it
does so using a *previous* script (that does not know about 2010).

Could you just run the "msys.bat" again? It should have gotten the newest
version in the previous run and use that from now on.

Ciao,
Johannes

Please look at the end of said core log. In the line above that
stacktrace, it suggests that "the user has the camera open already"? Is
it possible that another uManager instance is still running?

Yes, but how do I run it again, and where can I find it?  I tried running
the installer again, and I tried building Micromanager again from the
git-bash file in the development environment folder, but I got the same
error both times.

Please look at the end of said core log. In the line above that
stacktrace, it suggests that "the user has the camera open already"? Is
it possible that another uManager instance is still running?

This is pretty strange. This morning I got the same message in the log
about the camera being open already, but I have made absolutely certain
that there was not another instance running.  I then tried Live view and
Snap, which both work correctly. After this I tried to open the SPIM plugin
again, and there is still no response, but I don't get the message about
the camera being open anymore.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] All C++ developers: Transition to Visual Studio 2010
Message-ID: <CAKGYTBnwqOGKROnRFgmmtjKX+Vh0TZL4X1k53DwJfKYKLUHOfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Micro-Manager's Windows build is soon to make a long overdue switch from Visual
Studio 2008 SP1 to Visual Studio 2010 SP1.

This should not affect most users (but help with testing will be much
appreciated).

If you are a device adapter developer on Windows, or otherwise build
Micro-Manager from source on Windows, you will need to switch to VS2010 SP1
(referred to simply as VS2010 below) at the time when the switch to VS2010 is
committed to teh SVN repository.

Currently, I have a private branch of MM building with VS2010. The VS2010
branch is maintained so that it is based off a recent head of the SVN trunk.
I plan to merge this branch with the trunk, if nothing goes wrong, on

  Thursday, October 10.

The nightly builds will also switch to using VS2010 at that time.

The consequence of the merge will be that all VS2008 project files (.vcproj)
will be removed and corresponding VS2010 project files (.vcxproj) will be
added. In addition, various changes will be made to allow MM to build with
VS2010.


What you need to do
===================

## All developers building C++ components

You will need to set up VS2010. Here are the instructions (if you are using the
free Express edition):

1. Install Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
(If the installer fails, go to Control Panels > Programs and Features,
uninstall everything with "Microsoft Visual ... 2010" in its name, and try
again. An incomplete installation can seem to work but later cause subtle build
issues.)

2. Install Visual C++ 2010 Express from
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express
(Refuse the invitation to choose Visual Studio 2012.)

3. Upgrade to Visual Studio 2010 (Express) SP1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691

4. Install this package to repair VS2010 SP1:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422

VS2010 can coexist with VS2008 on the same computer.


## Authors and maintainers of device adapters in the SVN repository

- I have ensured that all device adapters compile properly. Since I am unable
  to test most of the hardware, there remains the possibility of library
  incompatibilities at runtime, for device adapters that link to external
  libraries.

- Before the switch date, please download the VS2010 branch build (see below
  for a link to the installers) and test if your device adapter functions
  correctly.

- If fixes are necessary, please do not commit them to SVN before I merge the
  VS2010 branch (unless they are source code fixes that are also compatible
  with VS2008). Instead, please let me know by email.

- When I merge the VS2010 branch, there will be some changes to the project
  files in addition to simply converting from VS2008 to VS2010. Most of those
  changes have to do with centralizing project settings using Visual Studio
  property sheets (.props files). Please be aware of this (details are outlined
  in the next section). Further changes to make the build more maintainable
  will likely be made following the switch to VS2010 on the trunk, so please
  remember to run 'svn update' frequently.

- After I merge the VS2010 branch, please be careful not to commit VS2008
  project files to the repository.

If you keep your own version of the project file, please also see the next
section (but it would be best if you start over with the version in the VS2010
branch, and reapply any necessary local settings, such as library paths).


## Authors of device adapters _not_ in the SVN repository

To continue to build your adapter using the SVN trunk source code after the
VS2010 changes are merged, you will need to:

- Open your .vcproj file in VS2010 and click through the wizard to convert it
  to a .vcxproj file.

- In Project Properties > General, set 'Platform Toolset' to 'Windows7.1SDK'
  (make sure to set this for all Configurations and all Platforms).

- In Project Properties > Linker > General, reset 'Output File' to '<inherit
  from parent or project defaults>' (for all Configurations and Platforms).

- In Tools > Settings, choose 'Export Settings'.

- Open View > Property Manager. For each Configuration/Platform, right-click
  and choose 'Add Existing Property Sheet...'. Choose the
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMCommon.props file in the MM source (only
  available in the VS2010 branch).

- Repeat the previous step, this time to add
  buildscripts/VisualStudio/MMDeviceAdapter.props. When you're done, make sure
  that MMDeviceAdapter is displayed above MMCommon, at the top the list.

- Go back to View > Solution Explorer and once again open the project
  properties. Reset all of the following properties to '<inherit from parent or
  project defaults>' (make sure to first select all Configurations and all
  Platforms):

  - General > Output Directory
  - General > Intermediate Directory
  - General > Target Name
  - C/C++ > General > Warning Level
  - Linker > Debugging > Generate Debug Info
  - Linker > Advanced > Randomized Base Address
  - Everything under Build Events (there is no longer a need to have a copy
    command here), unless you have special requirements.

  These settings are now set in the common property sheets so that they don't
  have to be set for each device adapter. (We will likely move more settings to
  the property sheets in the future.)

If you prefer, you can test your VS2010 project file ahead of time using the
source code from my private VS2010 branch (see below for downloading).


## Developers who perform full or partial builds of Micro-Manager on Windows

Previously, there were a few Visual Studio solution (.sln) files scattered
around the source tree, and MMCoreJ_wrap/MMCoreJ_wrap.sln contained all device
adapters in addition to the Core and MMCoreJ. Built binaries were placed in
the directories bin_Win32/ and bin_x64/.

With the update to VS2010, there is a single solution file (micromanager.sln at
the source root) that is used to build all C++ components (Core, MMCoreJ,
MMCorePy, device adapters, and the not-very-well-maintained test projects).
Built binaries are placed in build/Release/Win32/ (or the corresponding
directory for the selected configuration and platform).

The fastest way to build several projects (e.g. the Core, MMCoreJ, and a
handful of device adapters) is to open micromanager.sln, right click each
project, and choose 'Build'.


Downloading the VS2010 branch
=============================

The source code, patch set, and binary installers for the VS2010 branch are
available here:
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~mtsuchida/ephemeral/expires-20131031/vs2010/

Once the VS2010 branch is merged into the SVN trunk (currently sceduled for Oct
10), this page will be removed.

Maintainers of closed-source device adapters can contact me directly to get a
copy of the patched source code (the installers include closed-source device
adapters).

I will periodically update the VS2010 branch to incorporate changes to the SVN
trunk.


Q & A
=====

Q: I tested a device adapter from the installer linked above, and it doesn't
   work. How sould I report this?
A: Please first make sure it is working with the VS2008 build (i.e. the current
   nightly build). If it is, please post to this mailing list and include the
   symptoms you observe when you try to add the device in the Hardware
   Configuration Wizard. Please also include the relevant contents of the
   CoreLog (with debug logging enabled). I will work with you to fix the issues.

Q: How do I build MMCoreJ.jar on the VS2010 branch?
A: One additional change has been made to MMCoreJ: the generated Java code is
   compiled by the Ant scripts (i.e. the same way all the other Java components
   are built), instead of invoking the Java compiler from Visual Studio. If you
   want to build just MMCoreJ.jar, after building MMCoreJ_wrap from VS2010, run
   the following command from the command prompt, in the MM source root (Apache
   Ant is required):
   ant -f MMCoreJ_wrap\build.xml

Q: How do I build LibraryTest?
A: Open micromanager.sln, select the Platform, and right-click LibraryTest, and
   choose 'Build'. The output can be found at e.g.
   build/Release/Win32/LibraryTest.exe

Q: Why not keep both .vcproj and .vcxproj in the SVN trunk, so that either
   VS2008 or VS2010 can be used?
A: I'm sorry, but that would be too much of a maintainance nightmare....

Q: Why not switch to VS2012?
A: We hope to do so eventually, and the switch from VS2010 should be relatively
   easy (compared to VS2008 -> VS2010). Just want to take things one step at a
   time. Also, I think it will be relatively easy to build with VS2012 using
   VS2010 project files, as the changes are not as drastic as between VS2008
   and VS2010.


Thanks for bearing with all that.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
Mark

Cool, good info to know.
Can you please tell me if I need Professional, Premium, etc. and/or if 
the MSDN is needed?
Also, would be worth going straight for 2012 if it's backward compatible?
Thanks

When you run the installer, it asks you where you want to install the
development environment, defaulting to C:\OpenSPIM-dev-env. That is where
the msys.bat lives.

Okay, then our build system does not work... I will have to defer that to
Luke because I am too short on time, preparing for a one-week work trip.

Hmm. I run out of ideas... :-(

Hi Aurelia,

The build error isn't exactly a chicken and egg problem, but a matter of dependencies: when Micro-Manager is built on VS2010, people without the 2010 runtime can't run it. I recently ran into this problem, and assuming 2010 was backwards-compatible, changed MM to build in 2008 mode. Hence your error; I expect anyone with only VS2010 installed will experience a similar issue.

A possible fix is to use VS2010 to open the solution file, right click on the MMCoreJ project and click properties, and change the Platform Toolset to v100 (I don't recall exactly where the option is; sorry!). You may need to change this for other projects as well, but then the build script should work.

After next week Thursday I should be able to provide a more permanent fix, since Micro-Manager will officially upgrade to VS2010. (The missing files that started all this will be packaged with Micro-Manager, so I only need to resynchronize our code to get all the benefits.).

Regarding the error you're getting, I truly have no idea. I should point out that this is technically progress over the ThorLabs problem; the plugin doesn't try to create a pixel size configuration until it verifies the setup is correct. When it does try, however, it seems to cause an error in the camera device. I can't trace the error yet; if you get the project building, you might check the file/line the core log mentions for clues. I may be able to help further on Monday.

A possible workaround would be to launch Micro-Manager, create a pixel size configuration manually -- as long as it's positive, the plugin shouldn't try to create a new one, and so may avoid this issue.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you come up with anything.
Luke

For the Core and the vast majority of device adapters, Express (with
SDK 7.1 and VS2010 SP1) should be sufficient.

> Also, would be worth going straight for 2012 if it's backward compatible?

I'm hoping upgrading to VS2012 will be much easier, and it will be
nice to do it before we get 3 years behind.

It looks like VS2010 SP1 project files will work in VS2012 without
conversion if VS2010 SP1 is installed on the same computer (presumably
using the VS2010 libraries and compilers)
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh690665.aspx).
However, normal Visual C++ 2012 project files will probably not work
with VS2010.

Most of the work in upgrading to 2010 was in getting our ~140 device
adapters to build correctly. I don't (yet) know what to expect for the
various third-party libraries when building with 2012 (just haven't
tried yet).

Best,
Mark

Sorry, I think I got the wrong reply emails somehow.  Here's what I sent 
to Michael Weber only:

Hi all, thanks for the numerous replies.

I have the .step files from the wiki, and in fact I used MeshLab 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeshLab) to convert them to .dxf files to 
give to my machine shop guy.

My request is that of a complete unit, in it's functional form, i.e. all 
the CAD files in one window.  I think it would be a useful asset to have 
available for those just starting the process.  I am thinking about the 
options of multi-color and other extensions and I wanted to know how 
much extra breadboard I might need, and how much space I have in various 
places.

I would be ok with any file type that included everything. SolidWorks 
would works if it's versions 2003 to 2010...  These files go straight 
into AutoCAD:
     *.prt, *.sldprt (part) - versions 2003 - 2010
     *.asm, *.sldasm (assembly) - versions 2003 -2010
Obviously AutoCAD files .dwg, .dxf would be cool too as I have the 
student version of AutoCAD from my graduate studies.

In the spirit of Open Source, Blender has an option to import VRML 1.0 
files exported from SolidWorks 
(http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Tutorials/Render/Import/SolidWorks). 
I haven't had any experience with this, but it might be a good place to 
keep things easy access for rendering.  Blender also .3ds files, so 
exporting from AutoCAD or 3dsMax to .3ds would also keep things open.  
.stl files are also an option, see here: 
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Data_System/Files/Import

I'm not sure if there's a 'Blender' of the CAD world, so to speak, so I 
can't comment in that direction.  Be nice to know if there were.

If anybody has such a complete file, in nearly any of the aforementioned 
(don't you just love it when you get a chance to slip words like that in 
here and there) file types, please feel free to send me a link (be nice 
to get it on the wiki too).

Thanks in advance for your time.

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8ZXM5nAyhh56rb5Rva-8vcxfBEi8ANav4mE5H70TnwNJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Doing a manual pixel size calibration before opening the camera has in fact
solved the problem!  I'm now able to acquire stacks, with the Thorlabs
shutter acting in place of the laser.  Fantastic!  Thank you!
I wasn't able to change the platform toolset in the MMCoreJ solution file;
it seems to be something one can only change in the project file.  This is
not urgent for me anymore though, so if the general MicroManager upgrade
will solve the build problem then that's great.
Thanks for all your help, I am looking forward very much  to starting data
collection!

Aurelia

Hi Edgar,

Nothing in this thread dump seems to me to indicate a dead lock of any kind -- however, I suspect the issue with 'insert stack at this Z plus' is being caused by an exception being thrown and not being presented to the user interface. Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.


Thanks,
Luke

Subject: [OpenSPIM] First SPIM image! and new acquisition problem: writing
	to disk
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8acqWbGg_kfjOXZ=rvapfLUw5k2apr4R4JhDC54Pbp_Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry, I have been asking a lot of questions lately, but I have at least
one more today.  I can now acquire a stack, but only if I leave the Output
directory field blank (I attach a projection of my first SPIM image, which
I'm very happy about). If I put in a directory, then when I push Snap
nothing happens.  It doesn't seem to matter which folder I use, and there's
no entry in the core log.  If it's a non-empty directory, I do get a
message warning me that any OME-tiff files will be deleted, but after I
dismiss the message nothing happens once more.  Has anyone had a problem
like this before?  Could it be Windows 7 related?

Thanks again,

Aurelia

Hi Luke,

I attach a corelog that was just made. In the OpenSPIM.app folder also appears a .log file named hs_err_pid5456, maybe
could be helpful as well. I have to point out that I am not controlling the laser using the plugin (the laser I am using
is not supported by MicroManager) so as happen with Aurelia a message is shown saying that my setup appears to be invalid
before executing the acquire SPIM image plugin.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Nothing in this thread dump seems to me to indicate a dead lock of any kind -- however, I suspect the issue with 'insert stack at this Z plus' is being caused by an exception being thrown and not being presented to the user interface. Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.


Thanks,
Luke

There is really no reason to be sorry about that. Scientists have a track
record of lacking the desire to communicate effectively, so I enjoy very
much that you are an exception!

This is a really awesome picture! Would you mind uploading it to the wiki
and adding it to the gallery? I can help you with that should there be any
problems.

Could you copy the ImageJ-win32.exe in OpenSPIM.app/ and rename the copied
file to debug.exe and run that? This should give you a console output (I
strongly suspect an exception to occur, which I would be really eager to
see, maybe you could copy/paste it into a reply?).

It is probably the same issue in that case.

Quite possibly. But I can only guess without having a glimpse at the
console output.

Ciao,
Johannes

I have updated the patch set and installers (available from the same
link). The VS2010 test build now includes changes on the SVN trunk up
to yesterday (20131008 PDT).

I have also added a patch (22/22) that renames the Visual Studio
project files for some of the device adapters, where the name did not
match the name of the device adapter (the device adapter name is
generated from the project name in the Visual Studio solution used to
build, which, confusingly, can differ from the project filename). This
is a good opportunity to eliminate the inconsistency, since the
filenames are changing anyway (from .vcproj to .vcxproj). The
directory names containing the device adapter projects are also often
inconsistent with the project name and adapter name, but I'm leaving
this unchanged to prevent confusion (and repository administration
complexities).

All this will be merged to the trunk tomorrow (Oct 10). We may briefly
disable write access to the repository during the merge; progress will
be posted here.

Best,
Mark

Thanks!  I'm glad you are enjoying my constant questions.

I have added the Volvox picture to the gallery on the wiki, and also added

There is in fact an exception, here is the debug console output:

To be precise, my updater claims (in the details) that it was released on
18 Jun 2013 (near the top), and that the update site is Fiji (at the bottom).

Hi Edgar,

This core log seems incomplete -- I'm guessing the output was buffered (not written to disk) and got lost somehow; did you close MM before attaching the file?


If you're getting an invalid setup warning (because of a missing laser), that is almost certainly the cause; the acquisition process attempts to directly control the 'laser' at various points, which would cause null pointer exceptions if no laser was found. If you have no MM-compatible shutter attached, one temporary workaround might be to add the DemoShutter -- this object does nothing of significance when it is controlled, but it should trick the plugin into believing the setup is complete. In hardware setup, just add DemoCamera/DHub and select only the DemoShutter peripheral. Then on the final page be sure it is set as your default shutter.


The ideal permanent solution would be to obtain a device adapter for your laser so that the plugin *can* control it -- perhaps we could contact the manufacturer and suggest it to them, as they would know best how to interact with the laser hardware. On the other hand, the plugin should probably be prepared for the absence of a laser; I'll look into this as time permits, though through the next week or so I will probably have my hands full with source code management.


Thanks,
Luke

Thanks very much for doing that. That's the spirit! Am I the only one here who recognised this as Volvox ;-). I assume its autofluorescence. Very nice sample.

Hi again,
In fact, loci-common was completely missing.  I then looked at my update
sites, and for some reason only the ImageJ site was checked, the Fiji and
OpenSPIM ones were not.  This is odd because I remember confirming that
they were active earlier, when I first installed everything.  Checking them
and then updating has made writing to disk during acquisition work, so I am
delighted.  I am also beginning to dimly sense the lesson that whenever
things don't work I should always double-check that everything is updated
correctly...

I think I know why... :-( It is a bug in the fall-back when the updater is
not working (and it was not working recently due to unexpected changes in
http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites).

I will try to do something about that so it does not happen anymore in the
future!

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi All,

The Visual Studio 2010 patches have now been committed to the SVN
trunk (r11918 through r11946). You will now need to use VS2010 to
build the head.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or difficulties.

Best,
Mark

 Hi Luke,

I did close MM before attaching the file. Now I set the demo Shutter as default shutter and no longer
receive the message of setup invalid. But the problem of the Z stack button remains.

I just discovered something: when I open the SPIMage plugin and move the stage, snap, add position to the list, etc..
after closing MicroManager/Fiji any error file appears in the OpenSPIM.app folder but as long as I press the Stack at this Z plus
button a new error file appear after I close MicroManager/Fiji. Maybe in the error file is the clue.

I attach the new core log and the lastest error file created.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

This core log seems incomplete -- I'm guessing the output was buffered (not written to disk) and got lost somehow; did you close MM before attaching the file?


If you're getting an invalid setup warning (because of a missing laser), that is almost certainly the cause; the acquisition process attempts to directly control the 'laser' at various points, which would cause null pointer exceptions if no laser was found. If you have no MM-compatible shutter attached, one temporary workaround might be to add the DemoShutter -- this object does nothing of significance when it is controlled, but it should trick the plugin into believing the setup is complete. In hardware setup, just add DemoCamera/DHub and select only the DemoShutter peripheral. Then on the final page be sure it is set as your default shutter.


The ideal permanent solution would be to obtain a device adapter for your laser so that the plugin *can* control it -- perhaps we could contact the manufacturer and suggest it to them, as they would know best how to interact with the laser hardware. On the other hand, the plugin should probably be prepared for the absence of a laser; I'll look into this as time permits, though through the next week or so I will probably have my hands full with source code management.


Thanks,
Luke

Would you kindly attach a core log of a session with this issue? There may be useful information there.

Hi Angela et al:

As I've mentioned on the OpenSPIM mailing list, I'm currently in the process of synchronizing our version of Micro-Manager with the latest source code changes (to pull in the VS2012 updates and new build process). Thankfully, this is nearly complete; I expect to be finished in a few days. At that point, I'll update the version of the code we have on our Fiji update site; if you're using the OpenSPIM package (downloaded from our wiki), you should only need to update Fiji to get the latest version of Micro-Manager and the PicardStage adapter.


Once that's complete, I'm hoping to simplify our source code quite a bit, so we can submit our device adapter to the Micro-Manager repository as Nico suggested; this way the device adapter will be included in the new builds of Micro-Manager, and so you'll need only download new versions of Micro-Manager as they are released. I'm hesitant to put an exact timeline on this step, but ideally it will happen within a week or two.


In the mean time, you shouldn't have any trouble using our device adapter provided through our Fiji distribution. (If you are using the 32-bit version of Micro-Manager, it may also work to copy "mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll" and "PiUsb.dll" from our mm/win32 directory to Micro-Manager's directory in Program Files.)


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

It is not in our repository and I do not think that it was ever part of a Micro-Manager distribution. You can ask them to contribute the code to the Micro-Manager repository so that it will be incorporated in future builds.

Hello everyone,

I've finished updating the plugin to use (nearly) the latest Micro-Manager base. The changes have been pushed to our update site; please be sure you update Fiji to get the latest code (This is a good idea in general, particularly if you encounter a possible issue.). I should point out that completely updating Fiji sometimes takes two or three goes before all changes have been acquired successfully; please make sure that the updater says "Your ImageJ is up to date!" at the end (or, if you're tinkering with the development environment, there will only be locally-modified files).


There is one known issue I've encountered: having the plugin auto-start with Micro-Manager causes stage controls to not function. (I suspect the startup sequence for Micro-Manager has changed, causing the startup script to run earlier than expected.) As a temporary workaround, please do not auto-start the plugin. I hope to have a fix for this tomorrow or early next week.


I also expect people using unexpected hardware may receive load errors saying the device adapter interface versions are mismatched. (This may also happen silently, causing unexpected program crashes.) If this is the case, please download the latest _non-nightly_ version of Micro-Manager and try the adapters from there. (For reference, the Hamamatsu device adapter we distribute now comes from the October 11 nightly build: http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_32bit_1.4.16_20131011.exe -- any device adapters from that release will almost certainly work with OpenSPIM.)
N.B.: The latest nightly build has once again changed version numbers, so device adapters from that build will _not_ load in OpenSPIM -- yet. :-)


Some special notes for people using our development environment:
- You will need to "git pull" to update to the latest source code.
- Your device adapters may not show any need for updating, but their use could cause trouble -- see the above note for where to find replacements, if you aren't building them from scratch.


As always, if you encounter any problems, feel free to e-mail myself and/or the list; I'll do my best to address issues as they are raised.


Thank you,
Luke Stuyvenberg

 Hi dear All,

I have made some imaging of a zebra fish that expresses GFP fluorescence with a heat shock, I have gotten 25 stacks (5x5) and stitched it together.
2 µm green beads were embedded  to the agarose and I think that the beads signal is good in contrast to the signal of the fish. 

I would like to know if with the concentration of beads that could be appreciated in the Z projection and the video of the scanning of the resulting stack
is enough to perform multiview fusion.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Subject: [OpenSPIM] windows crash after today's update
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8YoQxm_iJ-U2mhQVtfJ_jO1kMMSrmsbgNj+49ZeVXPRHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have developed a new software problem: after I start the OpenSPIM plugin,
I get an "ImageJ has stopped working" message from Windows, followed a few
seconds later by a blue screen with the message "Process has locked
pages."  This happens after I start the OpenSPIM plugin or if I try to
start the camera live view.  A core log follows, but I don't think it shows
anything strange.
I can avoid the crash by doing a system restore back to last week, but in
that case for some reason my camera live view malfunctions (it opens and
runs, but doesn't display the live image).
Is anyone else having this problem?

Thank you,
Aurelia

Dear Edgar,

I am not sure I understand what you did. How did you stitch them together? Is this multi-view (angle) data or a tiling across a large field of view?

In any case you most likely do not have enough beads in there. I would say you need ten times more.

Your beads are gigantic, 2um, we use much smaller beads typically.

Let me know more details and I am sure we can work it out.

All the best

Hi Luke & OpenSPIM,

Congrats!

Do you happen to see any pattern to the undetected incompatibilities
(such as the Micro-Manager version from which the device adapters
came)? (I might want to investigate if (and probably only if) there is
a recurring pattern that looks like more than unrelated bugs or
incompatibilities with non-device-adapter DLLs. Never mind if it
appears unpredictable.)

> N.B.: The latest nightly build has once again changed version numbers, so device adapters from that build will _not_ load in OpenSPIM -- yet. :-)

In case anybody cares, the incompatibility is since October 22 (SVN
r11996) (i.e. MM nightly build device adapters from Oct 22 onward are
incompatible with Luke's present update, or with MM 1.4.15, the latest
release version).

Ironically, that incompatibility was introduced in order to prevent
crashes that could occur due to incompatible device adapters. The
problem was usually seen when using the MultiCamera device, and is
most likely to be observed when using (real) camera device adapters
that are compiled by a different version of Visual Studio.

Best,
Mark

 Dear Pavel,

The data is a tiling across a large field of view, for the stitching I used the Grid/Collection Stitching plugin from
Fiji, it works perfectly. So I will buy the 0.5 um beads that are recommended in the OpenSPIM wiki and have a greater concentration. This image was only a test with the beads that we have already available. Thanks a lot for your update.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Ok, I thought its something like that. Definitely use more beads and smaller diameter.

All the best

Subject: [OpenSPIM] "Stack at this Z plus" problem persisting
Message-ID: <OFECA4AB2E.7EFED603-ONC1257C0F.005F83DC-C1257C0F.005F8542@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear Luke,

I am sorry to disturb you again but I have been struggling a lot with SPIM acquisiton plugin :(. Hopefully I made some discoveries.

I updated Fiji and again had the problem again about the TIScam (The Imaging Source camera). But I discover that 
mmgr_dal_TIScam.dll depends on TIS_DShowLib10.dll and TIS_UDSHL10.dll but in the mm\Win32 location are
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9d.dll and TIS_DShowLib09.dll. I got the version 10 of the DLLs from the 1.14.16 version of a plain 
installation of MicroManager and just copied them to mm\Win32. Maybe you can solve that from the Fiji updater: to uninstall 
the version 9 of the DLLs and to install the version 10. Anayway the problem about the camera is fixed now. I attach the
version 10 of the DLLs to this mail.

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button I still have the problem when using the updated version of Fiji. I also discover that if I don't 
use the demo shuter I can't write the images direclty to disk, the message "Error acquiring: null" appears and in the output directory is saved a .ome.tiff
empty image (0 byte). So for the moment I have to use the no updated version of Fiji in order to perform SPIM acquisiton.

The problem about using the no updated version of Fiji is that the plugin don't respond when pressing "Oh Snap" (as
it happens when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" in the Fiji updated version) when I want to write the images directly to disk.

So at the end if I want to perform SPIM image acquisition (the way I have done that until now), I have to use the no updated version 
of Fiji and save the images to RAM no specifying an ouput directory. The problem is that I am limited by the RAM and all the images
are saved in the same stack even if different positions are specified in the position list.

Finally to be sure that the problem about the "Stack at this Z plus" button is not related to the computer I am using (Windows XP 32 bit)
I tried Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bit).

I really would like to use the SPIM image acquisition plugin and benefit from all his capabilities.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Please don't worry about disturbing me; it's what I am here for, after all!

You are absolutely correct about the missing TIScam DLLs; I forgot to include them in the new version. I will head to LOCI and correct that in two hours or so.

I'm still at a loss with regards to the errors you are encountering, however. I will have a patch for the 'no laser' problem early next week, hopefully alongside the autostart fix, but until we can diagnose the acquisition bug, I won't know how to fix it.

With that in mind, I have some more information to request:
- Please attach to your reply all core logs, hs error files, and configuration files (your active one, in particular), compressed with your file archiver of choice.
- Please list a) all hardware involved in the setup (with model numbers, if you have them), and b) all devices you set up in the hardware configuration.
- When you click the 'insert stack' button, you say it sticks down and nothing happens -- is the rest of the UI still responsive? Can you change tabs? Move the stage?

I'm casting a pretty wide net, here, but hopefully somewhere in there will be a vital clue.

Thanks,
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about this. It sounds like this is a device adapter problem, most likely in the camera. If you can, please try copying the device adapters and extra DLLs from the Micro-Manager build I linked to in the update email -- it's possible either the DA or a manufacturer DLL has been upgraded.

Did the error create an error log? This would be something like hs_err_pid1234 -- if a file like this was created the same day as the crash, could you please attach it to a reply?

Thanks,
Luke

 Hi Luke,

I will send you all the information requested on monday, since now I am not at the
institute. Hopefully with the no laser patch the problem could be solved, but we have
to try first. 

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button, it is the only problem, it looks that it sticks. I can still
move the stage, change the tabs, add a new single position in the position list, use snap
images and save them in RAM or directly in disk. In resume, I can do everything except set a 
stack of positions in the position list.

Thanks to you!! and see you on monday.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Please don't worry about disturbing me; it's what I am here for, after all!

You are absolutely correct about the missing TIScam DLLs; I forgot to include them in the new version. I will head to LOCI and correct that in two hours or so.

I'm still at a loss with regards to the errors you are encountering, however. I will have a patch for the 'no laser' problem early next week, hopefully alongside the autostart fix, but until we can diagnose the acquisition bug, I won't know how to fix it.

With that in mind, I have some more information to request:
- Please attach to your reply all core logs, hs error files, and configuration files (your active one, in particular), compressed with your file archiver of choice.
- Please list a) all hardware involved in the setup (with model numbers, if you have them), and b) all devices you set up in the hardware configuration.
- When you click the 'insert stack' button, you say it sticks down and nothing happens -- is the rest of the UI still responsive? Can you change tabs? Move the stage?

I'm casting a pretty wide net, here, but hopefully somewhere in there will be a vital clue.

Thanks,
Luke

 Dear Luke,

I am sorry to disturb you again but I have been struggling a lot with SPIM acquisiton plugin :(. Hopefully I made some discoveries.
 
I updated Fiji and again had the problem again about the TIScam (The Imaging Source camera). But I discover that 
 mmgr_dal_TIScam.dll depends on TIS_DShowLib10.dll and  TIS_UDSHL10.dll but in the mm\Win32 location are
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9d.dll  and TIS_DShowLib09.dll. I got the version 10 of the DLLs from the 1.14.16 version of a plain 
 installation of MicroManager and just copied them to  mm\Win32. Maybe you can solve that from the Fiji updater: to uninstall 
 the version 9 of the DLLs and to install the version 10. Anayway the problem about the camera is fixed now. I attach the
 version 10 of the DLLs to this mail.

About the "Stack at this Z plus" button I still have the problem when using the updated version of Fiji. I also discover that if I don't 
 use the demo shuter I can't write the images direclty to disk, the message "Error acquiring: null" appears and in the output directory is saved a .ome.tiff
 empty image (0 byte). So for the moment I have to use the no updated version of Fiji in order to perform SPIM acquisiton.
 
The problem about using the no updated version of Fiji is that the plugin don't respond when pressing "Oh Snap" (as
 it happens when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" in the Fiji updated version) when I want to write the images directly to disk.
 
So at the end if I want to perform SPIM image acquisition (the way I have done that until now), I have to use the no updated version 
 of Fiji and save the images to RAM no specifying an ouput directory. The problem is that I am limited by the RAM and all the images
 are saved in the same stack even if different positions are specified in the position list.
 
Finally to be sure that the problem about the "Stack at this Z plus" button is not related to the computer I am using (Windows XP 32 bit)
 I tried Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bit).

I really would like to use the SPIM image acquisition plugin and benefit from all his capabilities.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi again,
Thanks!  The problem was the DLL file and when I changed it to the correct
one the problem was resolved.  Sorry, I should have figured this out on my
own, but for some reason, Gmail decided to put specifically the update
email into my spam folder, but not the open spim emails before or after it,
so I hadn't seen it (and didn't know it was missing).  But now everything
is working again.
Thank you,
Aurelia

Hi Edgar,

Unfortunately the files were not as revealing as I had hoped. They seem to indicate a persistent problem with either the TIScam device adapter or the way we interact with it. (Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.


When you click the 'insert stack' button, it is only that button that sticks, correct? The remaining buttons still work? You can change between tabs, move motors, et cetera? Can it be un-stuck and clicked on again? It's still possible that there is a silent exception being generated; I'll check on that.


Also, please try updating to the latest version again -- I recently pushed an update that should eliminate the need for the demo-shutter trick by being prepared for the absence of a laser.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

About the error files, you are right, they appear as long as I close  µManager/Fiji. The "Stack at this Z plus" button is the only problem, I  can
still made everthing else as I menctioned before. I just updated Fiji and the problem persist. The button is unstucked as long as I move the mouse
cursor outside the area of the button and I am able to click it again. The problem is comparable as if I place the cursor over a normal button e.g.
Oh Snap!, then click the mouse and move the cursor outside Oh Snap! and finally release the mouse outside Oh Snap! 
If you do that simply nothing happens. That is just the way the "Stack at this Z plus" button behaves.

I also thought that the problem was related with the TIS cam but I already test Fiji in a different computer (Windows 7 64 bits). In that computer
is not installed any driver or software from the camera. I made a test using only the Picard Stage, a demo shutter and a demo camera
and the problem about "Stack at this Z plus" remains, the only difference I noticed is that when I close µManager/Fiji there is no error files.

Hope this information is useful. Have a happy longweekend. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Unfortunately the files were not as revealing as I had hoped. They seem to indicate a persistent problem with either the TIScam device adapter or the way we interact with it. (Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.


When you click the 'insert stack' button, it is only that button that sticks, correct? The remaining buttons still work? You can change between tabs, move motors, et cetera? Can it be un-stuck and clicked on again? It's still possible that there is a silent exception being generated; I'll check on that.


Also, please try updating to the latest version again -- I recently pushed an update that should eliminate the need for the demo-shutter trick by being prepared for the absence of a laser.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Edgar,

So the issue appears regardless of operating system (Windows XP versus Windows 7) and architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit)? Did you try going back to the no-shutter configuration? (It shouldn't have a problem now that I've added some checks for an absent laser.)


I take it all the motor controls are fully functional? That is, the sliders all report the current position correctly, and let you change the position without trouble, for all four stage axes?

I've uploaded another version of the plugin which is a little more direct about its error reporting; please try updating once more -- although this may not fix the issue, it might produce useful error output.


Thanks again,
Luke
