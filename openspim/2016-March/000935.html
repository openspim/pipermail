<PRE>Hello Tim,

Two questions need answering first:

1.) Are you in &quot;Lightsheet mode&quot;?!

This would &quot;half&quot; your frame rate, as the camera would read in only one direction (top to bottom) instead of bi-directional (from the center to the top and bottom).

And

2.) Assuming you are using the Picard stage: What is your motor dwell time set to?

As a standard setting it is set to 10 ms as to settle the sample from swinging, which could be your issue if you already set your exposure to 10 ms...

I hope that helps explain the problems you could be facing, if not good luck finding what else it could be.


Regards,
Pete

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Suboptimal acquisition speed

Hello all, 



Does anyone have experience troubleshooting frame rate problems? We have a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 that is theoretically capable of 100 FPS with a CameraLink card, but we get about half that using Micro-Manager/openSPIM. I have spent some time with Hamamatsu engineers and as far as we can tell the hardware works fine; we can reach expected speeds with Hamamatsu&#8217;s diagnostic software (XCAP). Rather it seems like MM is inefficiently communicating with the API, possibly not &#8216;expecting&#8217; or &#8216;asking for&#8217; frames at the same interval that they are being delivered from the camera. I really do not want to pay huge premium for Metamorph unless we absolutely have to, especially without knowing whether that will help. 



Thanks for any suggestions. 


Best, 




Tim
