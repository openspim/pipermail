<PRE>Hi Luke,

Resetting the Picard stages back to zero positions as you advised solved the issue with the OPEN SPIM GUI not starting. 

Thank you very much.

Best Regards,
John

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for helping me. Attached are the last three log files and a screenshot that shows that the OPEN SPIM files are up to date. I attached the log file for 11/03/2014 as it was working that day.

</I>They do indeed help; I see the problem -- one of your stages has moved
out of its expected range (most likely the twister, as the others have a
physical limit to their movement). I can push a software fix for this
soon, but there are two immediate workarounds (either one should work):

1. If you have the software for the Picard 4D stage, you can use that to
reset the position. (It can also be downloaded from the Picard
Industries website [1].) Launch the software, enter the appropriate
serial number, then click 'Home'.

2. If you do not have that software and would rather not download it, it
should still be possible to reset the stage's position from Micro-Manager:
- Launch Micro-Manager.
- Click Tools -&gt; Script Panel.
- Type or copy/paste the following (If you did not use the default
twister name, be sure to replace the text in the line below with the
correct name.):

mmc.setPosition(&quot;Picard Twister&quot;, 0);

- Press enter.

Please let me know if the trouble persists after this. I'll also soon
make change to the software to make sure this case doesn't stop the
software from loading in the future.

Thanks again,
Luke
