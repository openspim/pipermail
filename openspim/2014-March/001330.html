</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for helping me. Attached are the last three log files and a screenshot that shows that the OPEN SPIM files are up to date. I attached the log file for 11/03/2014 as it was working that day.

</I>They do indeed help; I see the problem -- one of your stages has moved 
out of its expected range (most likely the twister, as the others have a 
physical limit to their movement). I can push a software fix for this 
soon, but there are two immediate workarounds (either one should work):

1. If you have the software for the Picard 4D stage, you can use that to 
reset the position. (It can also be downloaded from the Picard 
Industries website [1].) Launch the software, enter the appropriate 
serial number, then click 'Home'.

2. If you do not have that software and would rather not download it, it 
should still be possible to reset the stage's position from Micro-Manager:
- Launch Micro-Manager.
- Click Tools -&gt; Script Panel.
- Type or copy/paste the following (If you did not use the default 
twister name, be sure to replace the text in the line below with the 
correct name.):

mmc.setPosition(&quot;Picard Twister&quot;, 0);

- Press enter.

Please let me know if the trouble persists after this. I'll also soon 
make change to the software to make sure this case doesn't stop the 
software from loading in the future.

Thanks again,
Luke
