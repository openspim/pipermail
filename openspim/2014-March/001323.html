<PRE>Hi Dr. Hoehn,

I'm afraid I lack some of the specialty knowledge to answer in great detail, but I'll offer my best guesses. My answers will be confined to my experience with the 3D viewer; I'm not acquainted with the BigDataViewer, but perhaps Johannes can offer insights on that point.

On 03/11/14, &quot;Dr S. Hoehn&quot; wrote:

</I>
Possibly not faster, but there would be several advantages to using a true 3D viewer over the projection plugin. The first is that...


&gt;<i> o	produce 3D projections (including one or more timepoints) that are freely rotatable (not ‘just’ around the x, y and z-axis)?
</I>

...yes, if the 3D viewer can show you your image data in 3D, it is freely rotatable. There are a few caveats. First, it would require a lot of computer memory, in particular to show the data without any downsampling (scaling the data down). I don't know that the current 3D viewer supports time points, but if it does, including the time evolution will also require significant amounts of RAM. Second, it may take a considerable amount of time to load the data and create a model out of it -- judging by the quality of your data, it may be quite a long time.

&gt;<i> o	produce cross sections in every possible angle by slicing?
</I>

I don't think the 3D viewer has this capability -- there is an orthoslice function, but that amounts to axial-only slicing. There may be a combination of plugins, however, which can rotate the data to whatever angle you like, then pull out a particular slice.

&gt;<i> •	If the above actions are possible with Fiji, would I have to use macros?
</I>


If you intend to repeat any process for several different sets of samples, a macro would certainly be advisable. In the context of this task, though, its use might be limited: a macro would have a difficult time recognizing a midsagittal section, so you would probably still need to indicate where to slice -- and if that's the case, it might not be so worthwhile. The best advice I can offer is to automate what you can and learn to enjoy what you can't. ;-)


(Please bear in mind that I am not intimately familiar with some of Fiji's more advanced capabilities. I suspect there is a way to train a 'midsagittal view recognizer' program to determine the correct angles at which to rotate and slice the sample, but it's entirely beyond my expertise to advise you on that. Johannes may be able to offer more details.)

</I>


We sometimes use BitPlane Imaris for viewing the final, reconstructed data from our OpenSPIM system; it comes down in part to preference. (However, if I'm mistaken in my answer to the above question, and significant parts of your analysis process can be automated, it's worth noting that I still haven't encountered software with the automation functionality to match Fiji's scripting and macros. If you intend to analyze a lot of these samples, pursuing the above options could pay off huge in the long run.)

Not at all! :-)


I hope you've found this e-mail helpful!

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Johannes and Luke,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some questions on the following points under ‘Data processing’ on the OpenSPIM homepage:
</I>&gt;<i> •	Browsing of OpenSPIM data with Fiji's BigDataViewer (coming soon).
</I>&gt;<i> •	3D rendering of fused OpenSPIM data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am working with spherical algae containing several embryos that are all differently positioned. I would like to visualize and analyse the embryos’ development. I am usually taking data for 20 to 40 hours in 2 to 3 min intervals, stacks ranging from 300-450 um at 4.5 um steps, from just one angle (data sets 100-200 GB).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am looking for solutions to search the time-lapse for specific developmental stages, crop individual embryos, rotate and slice them, so I get midsagittal sections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far I am using Fiji to produce a 3D-projection from one angle (which takes at least 10 hours) of the time-lapse. That shows me, when each embryo is in the wanted developmental stage. Then I crop embryos with Fiji. But to get a midsagittal section (by just choosing the accordant slice in the stack), I just have to be lucky that the embryo was oriented beneficially. So far I am not taking data from different angles but that would not solve my problem as I have to rotate the embryos in more than one axis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So these are my questions (I am pretty new to Fiji, so please excuse me if some are trivial):
