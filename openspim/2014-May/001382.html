Did you completely align the system? Please try adjusting the distance between the first two lenses (the ones on the long rail). The instructions at <A HREF="http://openspim.org/Advanced_Laser_Alignment">http://openspim.org/Advanced_Laser_Alignment</A> might also help.

This is quite difficult. Perhaps if a sample is mounted in the system, blocking one laser and then the other can show you where the two sheets are, relative to each other? I don't know the usual misalignment; we've only tried using two beams once before.


Good luck; hope this helps!
