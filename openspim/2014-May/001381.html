&gt;<i> I'm having an issue with acquisition that I wonder if anyone else has experienced. When I assign several positions, it frequently happens that when the stage moves to the next position, it will not complete the movement. Usually, it rotates and moves in the z direction but not y. I can observe the problem when acquisition is not running; if I double-click the row in the position list, the stage will move partially; then if I double-click it again, it finally moves to the correct position.Very odd. I've not heard of this or seen it, unfortunately, so I can only guess. First, a few questions:
</I>- Does this issue only happen with acquisition? That is, when you set the position with the stage controls tab, does the motor go to that location immediately?

- Is your pixel size calibration set? (To 1.0, or to the actual value?)
- Does the system produce any error messages? (These may not be visible normally; they should show up in a recent core log, though -- could you please attach one?)


And now are a few ideas:
- Are the thumbscrews on the stage slides all very lose? Each linear stage has one to hold it still while packing; the screw should be loosened or removed before using the stage.
- Are the stage wires clear of any obstructions?
- Try zeroing all the stages:
 - First, remove any sample.
 - From Micro-Manager, click Tools -&gt; Script Panel
 - In the bottom panel, type (pressing enter after each line):


mmc.setPosition(mmc.getFocusDevice(), 0);
mmc.setXYPosition(mmc.getXYStageDevice(), 0, 0);
mmc.setPosition(&quot;Picard Twister&quot;, 0);


 (The third one might fail if the twister has a different label.)


Please let me know if this helps, or if there's any new developments!
Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

</I>&gt;<i> I can get around this problem by adding a single frame at the start position for each stack before the stack is taken; then the stage moves to the correct position when it starts the stack. However, this is annoying because I record a lot of unnecessary frames and I think it might make the anti-drift function behave oddly. Anyone have a suggestion?
