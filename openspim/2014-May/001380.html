</I>I think it would be very possible. Basic use of the SPIM system -- setting up acquisitions and time-lapses -- isn't particularly complicated. As long as the system stays aligned (which seems to be a fairly long time) the operator needn't know much about the SPIM's optics to use it. (There *is* some value to it, though -- in my experience, for example, adjusting the corner mirror after inserting a new sample can sometimes improve the images the system records.) Occasionally checking the alignment with a mirror slide or similar is strongly recommended, of course, and having at least one person who is knowledgeable about the 'dirty details' to help in case of malfunction would be a good idea.

</I>
A full table is not, in general, necessary. It might be desirable, for instance if the table is self-leveling, but as long as the breadboard is fairly flat the system should be able to operate normally. (As a point of interest, I also don't see why the system couldn't be assembled directly on a table; this might allow for a very flexible system. I don't think anyone has tried this yet.)


Hope this helps!
