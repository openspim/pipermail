Hey Veli-Pekka,

This sucks!! They have a good selection of wavelengths too... I wonder if
there is anything we can do.

Have a nice weekend and a Merry Christmas/Happy New Year!!

Best Regards!
Pete

&lt;|&gt; Hi all,
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; FYI, I just got an email from Coherent: &#147;Unfortunately the Obis
cannot be
&lt;|&gt; controlled  with the MicroManager up to now. There are plans to make it
&lt;|&gt; work but this will be out at least 6 more months.&#148;

&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Thanks Michael for the answers and cc&#146;ing!
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Our initial plan is to build up a SPIM with a dual side simultaneous
&lt;|&gt; excitation by one laser wavelength at the time, and image colors
&lt;|&gt; sequentially. Laser (either 488nm or 561nm) is divided into two
identical
&lt;|&gt; illumination pathways to reduce shading and the need of rotation. So at
&lt;|&gt; least in the first version we have to replace the laser head between the
&lt;|&gt; channels. Maybe later we&#146;ll try to modify it so that we could use two
&lt;|&gt; lasers installed at the same time and control the excitation wavelength
&lt;|&gt; with &#181;Manager, if that appears to be possible. Do you think it is
&lt;|&gt; generally worth building a two sided illumination set-up compared to
&lt;|&gt; single sided illumination, or can we assume some unexpected problems
&lt;|&gt; arising from reflections or difficulties in aligning overlapping
&lt;|&gt; lightsheets etc.?
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; So anyone please, do you have any further information about controlling
&lt;|&gt; Coherent OBIS lasers with OpenSpim &#181;Manager? I haven&#146;t got any answers
&lt;|&gt; from Coherent. Would you like to share your experiences with sCMOS
&lt;|&gt; cameras as well?

&lt;|&gt; Subject: Re: OpenSPIM-related stuff
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Dear Veli-Pekka,
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; it was my pleasure to give the lecture in Oulu and I enjoyed my time in
&lt;|&gt; Finland! It's great to hear that you are moving into the SPIM field as
&lt;|&gt; well and I am happy to answer part of your questions. However, when it
&lt;|&gt; comes to software integration, I rather leave that to the guys on the
&lt;|&gt; mailing list, which is why I also put them on CC.
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; So if I get it right you want to build a two-color setup with
&lt;|&gt; double-sided illumination? Do you want to detect both colors
&lt;|&gt; simultaneously or sequentially? And how do you plan to use the
&lt;|&gt; double-sided illumination, also simultaneously or sequentially?
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Using a camera with a bigger sensor like sCMOS is possible and should
not
&lt;|&gt; be limited by the microscope objective or the emission filter, so no
&lt;|&gt; optical redesign is necessary here. However, additional components could
&lt;|&gt; be problematic and block light from reaching the edges of your chip.
&lt;|&gt; Those components are namely camera adapters with additional
&lt;|&gt; (de)magnification or image splitter. On the other hand, an image
splitter
&lt;|&gt; is a neat way to capture two colors simultaneously, especially on a big
&lt;|&gt; camera chip which has plenty of pixels to share. Some companies are now
&lt;|&gt; also modifying their splitters for sCMOS chips.
&lt;|&gt; Compared to a camera with a smaller chip, you lower your effective
&lt;|&gt; magnification (or in other words, you increase your field of view) if
you
&lt;|&gt; use the entire chip of an sCMOS camera. If there are components which
&lt;|&gt; limit the field of view (adapters, splitters), you end up with smaller
&lt;|&gt; useable area. But maybe that does not matter and you simply crop to the
&lt;|&gt; center of the chip, which would also increase your maximum frame
rate. It
&lt;|&gt; really depends on what you want to image and which spatial and temporal
&lt;|&gt; resolution you wish to get.
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Regarding the integration of camera and laser into the software, as I
&lt;|&gt; said, I am not up to date. But probably someone else from the mailing
&lt;|&gt; list can help here?!
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Best regards,
&lt;|&gt; Michael

&lt;|&gt; Hi Michael!
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; I still want to thank you for your visit here in Oulu in June. Your
&lt;|&gt; lecture was confirming our researchers that we need SPIM here as well,
&lt;|&gt; and happily we just got nice funding for the build-up costs of OpenSPIM!
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; We are planning the set-up now, and it we&#146;d like to have some laser and
&lt;|&gt; camera modifications to the dual side illumination version of OpenSPIM.
&lt;|&gt; Our plan is mainly clear with a few unsolved issues and I&#146;d
appreciate if
&lt;|&gt; you had time to answer couple of my questions? I&#146;ve browsed through the
&lt;|&gt; mailing list archives (and &#181;Manager discussions too), but have not find
&lt;|&gt; clear answers yet. So we&#146;d like to use Coherent OBIS-series lasers
&lt;|&gt; instead of CUBE (to get the 561 nm laser as well), and in one mailing
&lt;|&gt; list thread you and Peter Pitrone discussed that OBIS and other series
&lt;|&gt; have been used successfully in OpenSPIM. &#181;Manager has drivers for CUBE,
&lt;|&gt; but not a clear support for OBIS, so do you know how replacing the
lasers
&lt;|&gt; should work? Another question is related on the camera. We&#146;d like to use
&lt;|&gt; Orca-Flash 4 (or Andor Zyla 5.5) camera and we are mainly aware of the
&lt;|&gt; camera-drivers-computer &#150;related things, but do you know how people have
&lt;|&gt; fitted this larger sensor type camera to the detection pathway? Do we
&lt;|&gt; need some optical redesign to fill the whole sensor area, or is that
&lt;|&gt; smaller sensor size Orca-ER just &#147;cropping&#148; the signal and the original
&lt;|&gt; pathway design would fill the larger chip as well? Of course I could
&lt;|&gt; reform and write these questions to the mailing list if you prefer?
&lt;|&gt;
&lt;|&gt; Best Regards,
&lt;|&gt; Veli-Pekka
