Hello, everyone,

This is Yan.
Is there anyone who could tell me how many slices the system would take with the Picard Industries stage, and Andor camera?

I am estimating the cost time for a tissue sample with 1*1*1 mm3.

I am looking forward for your reply.

Sincerely,
Yan

Hi Yan,

I  get about 1.5 slices /second with the openspim plugin. There is a lot 
of overhead in the communication with the hardware (e.g. everything 
(laser power, x,y,z etc.) is set and queried even if the only parameter 
that changes is the z position.
I never was able to quite figure out why it is so slow.
Here is a profile output I posted to the list some time ago:

Hello, Robert,

Thank you very much for your explanation.

I got to know from the Picard Industries, the following information:
The 4D-Stage can not move 10 times in one second.
The USB communications takes about 100 ms to tell the 4D-Stage to move.
Then the 4D-Stage begins to move for the number of steps you wish to move.
This takes time along with detecting when the move is completed (more USB
communications).
It looks like the 4D-Stage can do about 3-4 moves per second, not 10.
You may be able to optimize this by reducing the amount of USB
communications.

I thought the system could take 3 or 4 slices per second, but after reading the paper by Pete,
I found that he took 1.35 or 1.7 slices per second from the data in the paper.
So I am confused about the movement.

Anyone knows how to improve the speed?

I am looking forward for your reply.

Sincerely,
Yan

Subject: [OpenSPIM]  Planning an appropriate SPIM build for my experiments
Message-ID: <fdb8980b-3415-1a00-5431-e76a1010a885@uvm.edu>

Hello OpenSPIM,

I've been following this list and reading papers in the field for about 
a year. In our lab, we've come to a point where we need to carry out 
long term fast nontoxic imaging of cell cultures that is only possible 
with SPIM, and have just obtained funding to build our own microscope to 
do these experiments. I was hoping to pick the brains of this mailing 
list to hopefully design an appropriate setup, perhaps based on the 
OpenSPIM platform, so that we can carry out these experiments.

In general, the experiment involves imaging HIV-infected T cells 
embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel as they migrate through the ECM and 
spread the infection to other cells and do various other things related 
to the infection, e.g. bystander cell killing. Here are some of the 
considerations:

1. We have fluorescently-tagged viruses in the FITC channel, a live cell 
apoptosis sensor in the iRFP channel, and will also need to somehow 
label nuclei and perhaps also membranes. That would be a maximum of 4 
channels, with 3 channels being "acceptable".

2. The cells will need to be imaged for 2 to 3 days, with a time 
resolution on the order of 2 Hz (for the full volume). T cells migrate 
at about 15 ?m/sec, and we would like sufficient time resolution to 
capture each cell at least twice during each body length movement (body 
length is about 10 ?m, hence needing around 2 Hz).

3. The entire volume (or close to that) of the hydrogel will need to be 
imaged at each timepoint. The volume of the hydrogel is up to our 
discretion, but generally it is on the order of 150 to 300 ?L.

4. Spatial resolution is not of particular concern, as we are more 
interested in the cells as whole entities rather than e.g. the details 
of virus assembly in each cell. However, we would like comparable 
resolution in all three dimensions, as there is no real "plane" we are 
interested in and the cells can go in any direction.

5. The hydrogel can be fairly optically dense, and we experience 
prohibitive distortion at anything deeper than ~100 ?m with widefield 
single photon imaging.

6. Of course, temperature control and media perfusion will be required. 
Given the nature of the pathogen, we will need to be able to fully 
decontaminate the sample chamber and anything that has come into contact 
with the media. We've been looking at Ernst Stelzer's TC-LSFM to get 
ideas for the tissue culture chamber. We have access to a fabrication 
service at our institute that can help us design and build the chamber.


Just to give you a general idea, we have about $100K available to us to 
purchase parts for this, not including the fabrication fee for the 
culture chamber for which we have other money set aside.

Other than general ideas of what direction we should be heading in, or 
links to papers for setups we could emulate, I also have some more 
specific questions:

A. Would two-photon imaging be an inevitable requirement given the 
density of the sample?

B. If the sort of speed of acquisition we are looking for is beyond 
reach for any system we could feasibly build ourselves (especially given 
the need for exposing in multiple fluorescence channels at each 
position), what should we sacrifice in our experimental plan to make it 
more within reach?

C. Does anyone know of any labs in the Northeast US/Quebec that have 
implemented a similar setup that we could go see in person? We are based 
in Vermont.


I appreciate the work everyone on this list puts in for newcomers, so 
thank you!

Best regards,
Mel

Hi,
My guess that Nikon objective will work with Olympus tube lens, but if you
want to know your magnification, you will need to correct it. Say, Nikon
x16 objective has x16 mag assuming 200 mm Nikon tube lens. Olympus tube
lens has f=180 mm, so magnification will be proportionally smaller: 16 *
180/200 = 14.4. Please correct me if I am wrong.

A little correction... the velocity of the cells is 15 ?m/min, not /sec, meaning that the desired imaging speed would be on the order of 2-3 volumes/min, which should be a bit more manageable!

Hi Leon,

you can get a 200 mm Nikon tube lens on Thorlabs (ITL200). They also have the appropriate adapters and mounts.

Dear All,

Has anyone recently had trouble with the registration of multi-view SPIM
data? If you encountered the problem described below I'll write a bug
report, but I first wanted to know if I'm just forgetting something:

I have been trying to register z-stacks from 3 angles at a single time
point with the old fiji plugin (SPIM Registration) and the new one
(Multiview Reconstruction). In each case when I try to choose a z-stack
for finding interest points I get the following error message:

(Fiji Is Just) ImageJ 2.0.0-rc-43/1.51a; Java 1.6.0_24 [64-bit]; Windows

I attached the z-stacks I wanted to register and fuse (as Google Drive

  spim_TL01_Angle2.tif [1]??
  spim_TL01_Angle0.tif [2]??
  spim_TL01_Angle1.tif [3]?

With the old SPIM Registration a window opens showing the first image of
the stack (instead of the entire z-stack) and it doesn't show any green
or red circles around beads, no matter where I set the threshold.

Would anyone have any ideas what's going wrong?

Thanks a lot!

Best wishes,
Stephanie

Hi Mel,

that?s a long list of requirements. Here are some thoughts:

- test your samples on existing light sheet setups
- also test/consider a diSPIM-like configuration
- 2-Photon is beyond reach for $100k - and hard to do for 3-4 channels
- a fiber-coupled laser launch with 4 lines will be expensive - you might want to start with less lines and upgrade later
- a feasible detection combination would be a single sCMOS camera plus a filter wheel

Best,
Michael

*Subject:* Open SPIM- Cube laser problems

Dear listers,

We need a good advice regarding OpenSPIM laser. We used the Cube, as 
recommended. And it died twice by now, after 50-60 hours of use. Talking 
with Coherent, we realized that the reason might lie on the OpenSPIM 
software. It repeatedly sends commands ?power?" "power=x" at each slice, 
and this command seems to wearing out EEPROM of the cube after a million 
cycles (which is about 50 hours of continuous imaging?)

I wonder- are you familiar with this  Cube issue? How do you work around 
it? did you remove the "power?" "power=x" commands out of the OpenSpim 
software, or do you use other type of laser?

Would be grateful for any tip!

Katja

I want to make a mock up of the sample chamber by 3D printing as we're testing our system. Has anyone tried this and does anyone have any AtuoCAD files we can have for this? There are some files on the website which are helpful but no in the format our 3D printer likes.


Alternatively if anyone has had any experience in converting the files on the OPENSpim website into an autocad friendly format that would helpful.

Hi Tanner


Many thanks for that helpful explanation. We do need to edit the autocad file because our objectives are from different manufacturers to those used by the Dresden team. Its also why I want to 3D print as I suspect we mayn't get it right first time. I'll have a go at converting the stl to a dwg and go from there.

Hi Ann,

The sample chamber has an stl format on the openspim website, which is the normal file for most 3D printers. You won't be able to edit this file in autocad though. If you want to edit it before printing it, you'll have to use an online stl to .dwg converter to open it in autocad. Then, after editing, you'll have to re-export it as an stl file again for printing.

If you just want to test print it, the provided stl file will do fine.

Hello, everyone,

This is Yan.
Is there anyone who could tell me how many slices the system would take with the Picard Industries stage, and Andor camera?

I am estimating the cost time for a tissue sample with 1*1*1 mm3.

I am looking forward for your reply.

Sincerely,
Yan

Hi Yan,

I  get about 1.5 slices /second with the openspim plugin. There is a lot 
of overhead in the communication with the hardware (e.g. everything 
(laser power, x,y,z etc.) is set and queried even if the only parameter 
that changes is the z position.
I never was able to quite figure out why it is so slow.
Here is a profile output I posted to the list some time ago:

Hello, Robert,

Thank you very much for your explanation.

I got to know from the Picard Industries, the following information:
The 4D-Stage can not move 10 times in one second.
The USB communications takes about 100 ms to tell the 4D-Stage to move.
Then the 4D-Stage begins to move for the number of steps you wish to move.
This takes time along with detecting when the move is completed (more USB
communications).
It looks like the 4D-Stage can do about 3-4 moves per second, not 10.
You may be able to optimize this by reducing the amount of USB
communications.

I thought the system could take 3 or 4 slices per second, but after reading the paper by Pete,
I found that he took 1.35 or 1.7 slices per second from the data in the paper.
So I am confused about the movement.

Anyone knows how to improve the speed?

I am looking forward for your reply.

Sincerely,
Yan

Subject: [OpenSPIM]  Planning an appropriate SPIM build for my experiments
Message-ID: <fdb8980b-3415-1a00-5431-e76a1010a885@uvm.edu>

Hello OpenSPIM,

I've been following this list and reading papers in the field for about 
a year. In our lab, we've come to a point where we need to carry out 
long term fast nontoxic imaging of cell cultures that is only possible 
with SPIM, and have just obtained funding to build our own microscope to 
do these experiments. I was hoping to pick the brains of this mailing 
list to hopefully design an appropriate setup, perhaps based on the 
OpenSPIM platform, so that we can carry out these experiments.

In general, the experiment involves imaging HIV-infected T cells 
embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel as they migrate through the ECM and 
spread the infection to other cells and do various other things related 
to the infection, e.g. bystander cell killing. Here are some of the 
considerations:

1. We have fluorescently-tagged viruses in the FITC channel, a live cell 
apoptosis sensor in the iRFP channel, and will also need to somehow 
label nuclei and perhaps also membranes. That would be a maximum of 4 
channels, with 3 channels being "acceptable".

2. The cells will need to be imaged for 2 to 3 days, with a time 
resolution on the order of 2 Hz (for the full volume). T cells migrate 
at about 15 μm/sec, and we would like sufficient time resolution to 
capture each cell at least twice during each body length movement (body 
length is about 10 μm, hence needing around 2 Hz).

3. The entire volume (or close to that) of the hydrogel will need to be 
imaged at each timepoint. The volume of the hydrogel is up to our 
discretion, but generally it is on the order of 150 to 300 μL.

4. Spatial resolution is not of particular concern, as we are more 
interested in the cells as whole entities rather than e.g. the details 
of virus assembly in each cell. However, we would like comparable 
resolution in all three dimensions, as there is no real "plane" we are 
interested in and the cells can go in any direction.

5. The hydrogel can be fairly optically dense, and we experience 
prohibitive distortion at anything deeper than ~100 μm with widefield 
single photon imaging.

6. Of course, temperature control and media perfusion will be required. 
Given the nature of the pathogen, we will need to be able to fully 
decontaminate the sample chamber and anything that has come into contact 
with the media. We've been looking at Ernst Stelzer's TC-LSFM to get 
ideas for the tissue culture chamber. We have access to a fabrication 
service at our institute that can help us design and build the chamber.


Just to give you a general idea, we have about $100K available to us to 
purchase parts for this, not including the fabrication fee for the 
culture chamber for which we have other money set aside.

Other than general ideas of what direction we should be heading in, or 
links to papers for setups we could emulate, I also have some more 
specific questions:

A. Would two-photon imaging be an inevitable requirement given the 
density of the sample?

B. If the sort of speed of acquisition we are looking for is beyond 
reach for any system we could feasibly build ourselves (especially given 
the need for exposing in multiple fluorescence channels at each 
position), what should we sacrifice in our experimental plan to make it 
more within reach?

C. Does anyone know of any labs in the Northeast US/Quebec that have 
implemented a similar setup that we could go see in person? We are based 
in Vermont.


I appreciate the work everyone on this list puts in for newcomers, so 
thank you!

Best regards,
Mel

Hello
I am gathering pieces to build an openSPIM. I have two Nikon water
immersion objectives and I am wondering if they will work with the Olympus
lens tube ?

Hi,
My guess that Nikon objective will work with Olympus tube lens, but if you
want to know your magnification, you will need to correct it. Say, Nikon
x16 objective has x16 mag assuming 200 mm Nikon tube lens. Olympus tube
lens has f=180 mm, so magnification will be proportionally smaller: 16 *
180/200 = 14.4. Please correct me if I am wrong.

A little correction... the velocity of the cells is 15 μm/min, not /sec, meaning that the desired imaging speed would be on the order of 2-3 volumes/min, which should be a bit more manageable!

Hello OpenSPIM,

I've been following this list and reading papers in the field for about 
a year. In our lab, we've come to a point where we need to carry out 
long term fast nontoxic imaging of cell cultures that is only possible 
with SPIM, and have just obtained funding to build our own microscope to 
do these experiments. I was hoping to pick the brains of this mailing 
list to hopefully design an appropriate setup, perhaps based on the 
OpenSPIM platform, so that we can carry out these experiments.

In general, the experiment involves imaging HIV-infected T cells 
embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel as they migrate through the ECM and 
spread the infection to other cells and do various other things related 
to the infection, e.g. bystander cell killing. Here are some of the 
considerations:

1. We have fluorescently-tagged viruses in the FITC channel, a live cell 
apoptosis sensor in the iRFP channel, and will also need to somehow 
label nuclei and perhaps also membranes. That would be a maximum of 4 
channels, with 3 channels being "acceptable".

2. The cells will need to be imaged for 2 to 3 days, with a time 
resolution on the order of 2 Hz (for the full volume). T cells migrate 
at about 15 μm/sec, and we would like sufficient time resolution to 
capture each cell at least twice during each body length movement (body 
length is about 10 μm, hence needing around 2 Hz).

3. The entire volume (or close to that) of the hydrogel will need to be 
imaged at each timepoint. The volume of the hydrogel is up to our 
discretion, but generally it is on the order of 150 to 300 μL.

4. Spatial resolution is not of particular concern, as we are more 
interested in the cells as whole entities rather than e.g. the details 
of virus assembly in each cell. However, we would like comparable 
resolution in all three dimensions, as there is no real "plane" we are 
interested in and the cells can go in any direction.

5. The hydrogel can be fairly optically dense, and we experience 
prohibitive distortion at anything deeper than ~100 μm with widefield 
single photon imaging.

6. Of course, temperature control and media perfusion will be required. 
Given the nature of the pathogen, we will need to be able to fully 
decontaminate the sample chamber and anything that has come into contact 
with the media. We've been looking at Ernst Stelzer's TC-LSFM to get

Hi Leon,

you can get a 200 mm Nikon tube lens on Thorlabs (ITL200). They also have the appropriate adapters and mounts.

Michael

Subject: [OpenSPIM] defining interest points fails
Message-ID: <c8fef2152327b71ca332d635bb0071c0@cam.ac.uk>


Dear All,

Has anyone recently had trouble with the registration of multi-view SPIM
data? If you encountered the problem described below I'll write a bug
report, but I first wanted to know if I'm just forgetting something:

I have been trying to register z-stacks from 3 angles at a single time
point with the old fiji plugin (SPIM Registration) and the new one
(Multiview Reconstruction). In each case when I try to choose a z-stack
for finding interest points I get the following error message:

(Fiji Is Just) ImageJ 2.0.0-rc-43/1.51a; Java 1.6.0_24 [64-bit]; Windows
7 6.1; 428MB of 490870MB (<1%)

I attached the z-stacks I wanted to register and fuse (as Google Drive
links, below). I chose the first one to find beads.​
  spim_TL01_Angle2.tif [1]​​
  spim_TL01_Angle0.tif [2]​​
  spim_TL01_Angle1.tif [3]​

With the old SPIM Registration a window opens showing the first image of
the stack (instead of the entire z-stack) and it doesn't show any green
or red circles around beads, no matter where I set the threshold.

Would anyone have any ideas what's going wrong?

Thanks a lot!

Best wishes,
Stephanie

Hi Mel,

that’s a long list of requirements. Here are some thoughts:

- test your samples on existing light sheet setups
- also test/consider a diSPIM-like configuration
- 2-Photon is beyond reach for $100k - and hard to do for 3-4 channels
- a fiber-coupled laser launch with 4 lines will be expensive - you might want to start with less lines and upgrade later
- a feasible detection combination would be a single sCMOS camera plus a filter wheel

Best,
Michael

*Subject:* Open SPIM- Cube laser problems

Dear listers,

We need a good advice regarding OpenSPIM laser. We used the Cube, as 
recommended. And it died twice by now, after 50-60 hours of use. Talking 
with Coherent, we realized that the reason might lie on the OpenSPIM 
software. It repeatedly sends commands “power?" "power=x" at each slice, 
and this command seems to wearing out EEPROM of the cube after a million 
cycles (which is about 50 hours of continuous imaging…)

I wonder- are you familiar with this  Cube issue? How do you work around 
it? did you remove the "power?" "power=x" commands out of the OpenSpim 
software, or do you use other type of laser?

Would be grateful for any tip!

Katja

Dear OpenSPIM list


I want to make a mock up of the sample chamber by 3D printing as we're testing our system. Has anyone tried this and does anyone have any AtuoCAD files we can have for this? There are some files on the website which are helpful but no in the format our 3D printer likes.


Alternatively if anyone has had any experience in converting the files on the OPENSpim website into an autocad friendly format that would helpful.

Hi Tanner


Many thanks for that helpful explanation. We do need to edit the autocad file because our objectives are from different manufacturers to those used by the Dresden team. Its also why I want to 3D print as I suspect we mayn't get it right first time. I'll have a go at converting the stl to a dwg and go from there.

Hi Ann,

The sample chamber has an stl format on the openspim website, which is the normal file for most 3D printers. You won't be able to edit this file in autocad though. If you want to edit it before printing it, you'll have to use an online stl to .dwg converter to open it in autocad. Then, after editing, you'll have to re-export it as an stl file again for printing.

If you just want to test print it, the provided stl file will do fine.

Dear OpenSPIM list


I want to make a mock up of the sample chamber by 3D printing as we're testing our system. Has anyone tried this and does anyone have any AtuoCAD files we can have for this? There are some files on the website which are helpful but no in the format our 3D printer likes.


Alternatively if anyone has had any experience in converting the files on the OPENSpim website into an autocad friendly format that would helpful.

Hi OpenSPIMers!

In the coming days, we will be upgrading the OpenSPIM wiki to the latest
MediaWiki components. So for the moment, to avoid data loss, the wiki has
been set to read-only. Apologies for the inconvenience. I will make another
announcement as soon as the upgrade is complete.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi all,

We resolved the issue with mails not being sent, as well as the twitter
feed ;-)

However, now we are going to upgrade the web server to the latest version
of Ubuntu. So there may be a small amount of downtime in a short while. We
will email again if there is any reason for continuing concern. Otherwise,
assume all is well!

Regards,
Curtis

Hi everyone,

The migration to the new web server is complete.

The site http://openspim.org/ has been updated to MediaWiki 1.27.0. We have
done a full audit of all installed extensions, pruning out the ones which
were not being used, and upgrading the rest. There were quite a few changes
on the technical side; e.g., the OggHandler extension was discontinued in
favor of TimedMediaHandler. Videos on the wiki seem to be working fine with
this new extension, but please speak up if you notice otherwise.

We also upgraded the MantisBT bug tracker to the latest version 1.2.19,
which went smoothly.

Loose ends still to resolve:

* Disappearance of "openspim.org" title at the top of each page.
* Twitter feed embedded on
http://openspim.org/EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy
* "Array" text shown in footer instead of creative commons logo
* Possible issue with wiki no longer sending emails (e.g., for password
resets)

We will continue to investigate and fix the above issues as time allows.

Let us know if you notice any other weirdness or brokenness.

Regards,
Curtis
