Hi,

We are interested in adding more laser channels to our current OpenSPIM. There seem to be three options: (1) multi-channel lauch, (2) laser combiner unit, (3) combine with mirror + dichroic.

If we go for option 1: Does anyone have experience with mult-channel modules which integrate well with the OpenSPIM platform? (Besides the Stradus Versalase I have seen mentioned on this forum, though updates on this unit might be helpful if anyone has strong feelings).

Any other comments on options 2 or 3 would also be appreciated. A few concerns have been addressed here:

Hi Kurt,

I pasted below a response to a similar question posed earlier to the list.  I am quite happy with a four-laser launch made by Vortran in California (no commercial interest).  The only downside is that OpenSpim software cannot currently control multi-laser launches.  I currently make do with Micro-Manager, a 3D SpaceNavigator mouse for coarse sample movement and the software that comes with the Picard motorized stage for fine movement.

Best,


Tim

Hi Matt,

We use a 488/561 Versalase with an ESio TTL controller to enhance
switching speed.  Our setup largely followed a design that was generously
provided by Johannes Girstmair in the Telford lab at University College
London, with a few modifications to fit our needs.  He provided me
extensive help that I can pass along if he has not done already.

Overall it works quite well.  If you use a TTL controller, you will want
to add the following to the Configuration Settings window in
Micro-Manager:

Laser_[A/B/C/D]_LaserEmission
Laser_[color]_DigitalPeakPowerSetting
TTL_State (I rename this setting 'color' and name the TTL states that
result in the desired outputs 'green', 'red' and 'off'.  This lets me set
multi-channel images by assigning the 'color' variable in Multi-D
Acquisition)

Turn on DigitalModulation in the Device Property Browser and you should be
set.  You have to switch LaserEmission on each time you boot up MM and if
you use a TTL controller PeakPower will determine the laser intensity.

Blanking mode will theoretically help acquire faster with minimized light
exposure.  However I have not got that to work; Micro-Manager's
auto-shutter seems to do the job well enough.

All the best,


Tim

Hi,
Simple question: is there a 50/50 beam splitter from Thorlabs someone could suggest for the dual illumination configuration?  I've found the BSW10 plate beamsplitter.   If there is an alternative method, please let me know. 
Thanks,

Hi Oscar

I would recommend getting a half-wave plate <https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=WPMH05M-488> and a polarizing beamsplitter cube <https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PBS101>. This is not cheap but the half-wave plate allows you to turn the polarization and to specify how much power you want in each arm. You can put (almost) all power in one arm or do a precise 50/50 illumination.

The question of alternatives to Picard appears sometimes on this list, so  
I thought I'd forward this. Mechanically it looks good to me, but I  
suppose some additional methods for the plugin would have to be added?

Hello,

My name is Kathleen Chen and I am a graduate student researcher at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My lab group is interested in building an
OpenSPIM according to the specifications provided on the OpenSPIM Wiki.

I have recently been looking at the parts list for the OpenSPIM website, in
particular the "self-made" parts. I noticed that there are some
inconsistencies between the PDF version and the STL/STEP files for two
parts: "RC1 vertical slit stilt" and "RC1 Ø1/2" lens stilt."

Specifically, the measurements in the files are different. For example, the
inner diameter of the slit stilt is 4.1mm on the PDF drawing, but the
STEP/STL files show the inner diameter to be 4.25mm. Which measurement is
the correct one to follow for the manufacturing process?

Thank you,
Kathleen Chen

Kathleen,

The hole through the stilt is a clearance hole for the M4x0.7 cap screw (or
#8-32 for the Americans) which will mount your 1/2" lens holder to the RC1.
The size standard for cap screws dictates shoulder diameter as 4 mm
maximum. A good quality cap screw is going to have a real world major
diameter measured at the thread of ~ 3.90 to 3.95 mm. The standard diameter
for a close fit clearance hole is 4.2 mm so you would go best with the 4.25
mm diameter. 4.1 mm might work for a short cap screw, long screws can bind
in the hole, but you'll need some "slop" in the fit to allow you room to
move/tweek the 1/2" lens, in its holder, concentric and perpendicular to
the beam axis.

You should note: just screwed together and mounted on the table it is very
unlikely your lens will be on the same axis as all of the parts purchased
and custom manufactured by "you" will have fit tolerances and error
including the concentricity of the Thorlabs doublet lens to the lens holder
it's mounted in. Careful parts and sub-assembly matching will go a long way
in tuning your build.

For what it's worth: contrary to a common held belief, screws don't locate
anything - they simply hold things down. Dowel pins or surfaces locate
items. The part designer here is co-oping the close fit between the cap
screw thread and the stilt hole it passes through in order to use the cap
screw as a poor man's dowel rod. This was very likely done as a cost
consideration as it's an inexpensive solution.

Best of luck with your build.

Hello,

there are different options for manufacturing: 3D printing or from metal.  
Many 3D-printed parts shrink slightly, so you have to design the parts  
slightly bigger, and my guess is that this is what happened here.

Anyway, you should look at the parts you are going to use - this  
particular hole you describe is for a M4 screw, but if you use imperial  
screw and not metric, it will be again slightly different, I guess.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Monica,


the controllers Standa makes are apparently supported by MicroManager (see https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Standa and https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Standa8SMC4), so actually no code changes should be needed from our side. If you’re willing to try these, I’d love to hear about your experience and would also help, should any integration issues arise.


cheers!

Hi Ulrik,

my Standa stages work with micro-manager. I can use them with Multi-D. 
Acq. However, I am not managing to start the OpenSPIM plugin. See 
Corelog attached. This is the crucial part:

so basically the function that asks stage positions in order to create 
the sliders in the plugin crashes.

Hi Monika,


the stage should actually work, for the function you mention the signatures are the same (see https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/master/DeviceAdapters/Standa8SMC4/Standa8SMC4.cpp#L1024 vs. https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/master/DeviceAdapters/PicardStage/PicardStage.cpp#L934, and, for fun also https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/master/DeviceAdapters/DemoCamera/DemoCamera.cpp#L3430).


However, it looks like the plugin is getting confused with which stage is which. That happens with non-Picard generic stages, as the plugin will then use GenericRotator/GenericXYStage, which match any stage device they find.


Could you please try setting their names to XY, Z and Theta, while adding the XY first in the hardware configuration wizard, save the config, restart MM and try again?


cheers!

Ok, I have it. The problem was somewhere else.

Standa stages don't have a maximum position property. As a result, the 
plugin tries to initialize with the default limit of 9000. My current 
position at the time of first testing was >9000, therefore invalid. When 
I moved all stages to 0, I can start the plugin and move the stage - up 
to 9000... Not satisfactory. I don't know how to fix it. I had a similar 
problem with the Picard Hi-Res, but that one had a Maximum property that 
can be read in the code. Standa only has 'Port' and 'Unit Multiplier' at 
config and the TransposeMirror in property browser, as far as I can see.

Ideas?

Regards,
Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] The shape of light-sheet from a illumination objective
Message-ID: <454038682.8350824.1482377085191.JavaMail.zimbra@sjtu.edu.cn>

Dear openSPIM list,

This is Yan, from China.
I built a light-sheet microscopy following the openSPIM,
but I found the light sheet shape changing from vertical to horizontal.

The optic path followed the openSPIM,
There was a vertical light sheet in front of the illumination objective.
This sheet focused in the position of working distance away from illumination objective,
the thinnest sheet in vertical direction.
But after this position the vertical direction height became smaller, 
and the horizontal direction width became larger. 
There is a position long away from the illumination position, 
the light sheet became thinnest in the horizontal direction.

Is there anyone knowing such thing? What is the problem?
I don't know the reason, so I don't know how to change the optic path.

I am looking forward for your reply.
Best regards,
Yan

Sounds like your distances are off. Check out the tips in the 'Assembling  
the telescope' instruction
