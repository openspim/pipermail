Subject: [OpenSPIM] A new type of sharper beam?
Message-ID: <D28DCFB6.72DD%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hi folks,

The following paper struck me as potentially very useful.  It seems that a simple(ish) array of slits in front of the cylinder lens can create a narrow, subdiffraction-sized sheet of light via interference which propagates without broadening.  Kind of a 2D Bessel beam.
"Toward the optical "magic carpet": reducing the divergence of a light sheet below the diffraction limit
In 3D, diffraction-free or Bessel beams are well known and have found applications in diverse fields. An analog in 2D, or pseudonondiffracting (PND) beams, is a nontrivial problem, and existing methods suffer from deficiencies. For example, Airy beams are not highly localized, some PND beams have significant side lobes, and a cosine beam has to be truncated by a very narrow aperture thus discarding most of the energy. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it is possible to generate a quasi-nondiffracting 2D light beam in a simple and efficient fashion. This is achieved by placing a mask consisting of a pair of double slits on a cylindrical lens. The applications include light sheet microscopy/optical sectioning and particle manipulation."

https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-40-21-5121

That sounds like a subdiffraction-width plane that almost anyone could make.  That is interesting to me as the extra complexity and cost of Bessel beams have led me to put off exploring more precise illumination methods for now.  As far as I can tell you just need to fabricate a sufficiently precise mask, and you might need a different mask for each wavelength.  What do you think?

Best,


Tim

Hi all, I hope the science is treating you well.

I have been looking at getting started with getting into the code, which I see is here:
http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/
but I'm a little lost about how to get started, and how to be part of the open source effort vs. just making my own version.

I'm a semi experienced programmer (a little Java, Pascal, C, Matlab, Igor Pro, LabView, NIDAQ to varying levels) and I have all the applications in place (Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio Express 2010, 2015, and all the java SDKs I might need).  Where I get lost is how to incorporate anything I do into the existing code?  What parts should I, can I work on?  Do these changes need to be vetted before being incorporated?  How do I get started with version control?  Etc. etc.  I feel this is, for me, the biggest hurdle in open source coding:  Not being able to code, but being able to 'open source'.  I've always been a lone coder up until this point, so please excuse my ignorance to these details.

Also, I think maybe I'm stuck on the Maven thing.  I see in the README.md that it's Maven, drawing on SciJava, and I can import into Netbeans for example.  Does anybody have any good links to help me get started with that?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Dear Neil,

It is great to have you as a contributor in OpenSPIM.
Simply, you can visit https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition> where all the SPIMAcquisition codes are located.
Jenkins compiles/packages these source codes and upload it to the OpenSPIM update site.

Please, use fork this repository for having your own version of the code. Some git knowledge is required to work with.
When you think your source codes are ready, you can simply create a pull request.
We will evaluate your changes and guide you to merge it to the production master branch.

Please, let me know if you need more help. I will try to help you as much as I can.

Best Regards,
HongKee

What you found here is actually not the source code, but a so-called
"Continuous Integration Server". Essentially it means that this is a web
server that also watches the source code in the background and builds it
whenever it gets updated.

Theoretically, it also runs all the regression tests (i.e. small snippets
of code that verify that what the programmer expected to work, ahem,
actually works). Practically, there is preciously little in the way of
regression tests because the student who wrote most of the SPIMAcquisition
code based a lot of faith in the code he wrote and skipped writing tests.

The only regression test, in fact, was written by HongKee, long after the
original author moved on to other pastures.

As pointed out by HongKee, the source code can be found at

	https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

The most important thing about the source code is that it is in a source
code "repository", i.e. a place where the code can not only be shared, but
contributions can be integrated easily. This is possible by the use of the
version control software called "Git". I encourage you to take 15 minutes
to learn how to use it (and why it improves your life) at:

	https://try.github.com/

More about integrating contributions below.

Good. They all have support for Git (actually, VS Express does not, but VS
2015 does, I am actually working on that ;-)). So all you need to do is
"clone" the repository mentioned above into your workspace.

You can then give the code a test run using the SPIMTestDrive class:

	https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/test/java/SPIMTestDrive.java

> Where I get lost is how to incorporate anything I do into the existing
> code?

Yeah, unfortunately this is my mistake. I was supposed to manage the
student writing the code and I failed to convince him to document things
so that the next person has a chance to dive in, too. So things are pretty
much undocumented.

I do not have enough time to answer questions, but I managed to give
HongKee an introduction into the code base before switching jobs, so maybe
you want to ask concrete questions on this list? (On this list so that the
impact of the answers is maximized and HongKee won't have to repeat
himself.)

> What parts should I, can I work on?

The Open Source idea is that you work on those parts that you need to see
improved. I am sure you have a couple of pet peeves that you would love to
see addressed. Those are good places to start from.

And again, if you have no idea where to start "scratching your itch", just
ask away, on this list.

> Do these changes need to be vetted before being incorporated?

The common process is that you create a copy of the repository on GitHub
(for historical reasons, this is called "forking"). In this copy, you can
do *everything* you like.

Then you will start improving the code. Once you have an improvement you
think is valuable also for others, you open a so-called "Pull Request" on
GitHub:

	https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

HongKee will review the changes, possibly make suggestions how to improve
or otherwise change the code, and eventually "merge" the changes.

Depending how polished you want your contribution to look, you might want
to go to the full distance and follow the advice in:

	https://github.com/maven-nar/nar-maven-plugin/wiki/How-to-contribute

(This is from a related project, but the advice applies to pretty much all
Open Source projects.)

> How do I get started with version control?

My recommendation is https://try.github.com/, but depending how visual you
work, http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/ might be
better. Or read the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. There are
tons of good resources available, my favorite being Git For Teams
(disclaimer: I reviewed this book before publication), but that one will
keep you occupied for a couple of evenings.

You might find it slightly challenging at first, because collaboration
always requires clearer communication than "lone coding", and also the
occasional compromise. I found that this requirement was most challenging
to most scientists, who are basically used (even encouraged!!!) to work
against each other all the time.

The advantage of Open Source coding is that you do not need to duplicate
work. You put in that extra effort to make the code work not only for you,
but for others, and then you can benefit from others' contributions just
the same as they can benefit from yours'.

This concept is very closely related to Isaac Newton's famous words: "If I
could see so far, it was only because I was standing on the shoulders of
giants". It is strange how far away science has deviated from that world
view.

> Also, I think maybe I'm stuck on the Maven thing.

Oh, Maven. Yep, it looks a little complex in the beginning, I agree.

Think of Maven as the system that allows programmers to stand on each
others' shoulders. It allows you to define what other software components
your software depends on ("dependencies"). For example, OpenSPIM depends
on Micro-Manager, which in turn depends on ImageJ. And the closer you
look, the more fine-grained things become. More details can be found here:

	http://imagej.net/Maven

Thanks Johannes, HongKee, I appreciate your time taken to get me started.

I'll check out all the links, bang my head against a few of the main starting points, and get back to the list once I get rolling.

Message-ID: <CO2PR05MB6819EA9AEFA951A6CD7CC21ECE10@CO2PR05MB681.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi guys,

I've gotten the following installed on the microscope controller PC (fresh Win7 64bit install):
- Netbeans 8.1
- JDK 1.7.0_80 (unchecking the open JRE option, assuming that my JRE 1.8.0_66 is all I need for my browser) (I've installed both 32 and 64 bit versions of both).
-  OpenSPIM-20150427 extracted

I created a GIT account, watched a few tutorials and have the gist for now - I'll come back to that once I get to understanding where I'm going to start making changes.  I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bsh/EvalError
at spim.SPIMAcquisition.main(SPIMAcquisition.java:1587)

I've attached the full output window with -e and -X settings in place (sorry if too verbose, I can provide other details if needed).

I thought there might be changes in the master repo, so I performed a pull, and on inspecting the differences it appears some changes has been made, but still I get the same error on running the code.  That's assuming I have incorporated those changes.  Does a pull automatically merge with my original clone?
I'm using the git options via Netbeans.

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil

Message-ID: <CO2PR05MB681C3681C7F827CCDA4BF8FECE10@CO2PR05MB681.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Has anybody got any experience with the power control slider not working when connected to a Stradus laser over a COM port?  I have made a short unlisted YouTube to show what's happening and save me a few words here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JEiMHxS69w

Key points:

-          I cannot control the power of the active shutter using the power slider - it jumps back to zero

-          When changing through the device controller (which works as it should on the laser itself) it shows what looks like a multiplication factor gone wrong somewhere on the slider.

-          At certain values the slider value jumps back and forth, which is strange

-          It only works for one of the lasers.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Thanks
Neil

The Stradus is not integrated with the Openspim plugin so power cannot be controlled by the slider. You can control the power using micromanager presets: one to turn on the Laser and another to set the power level. I am not sure why you need to turn the laser on before changing the power level, but in my experience that is what you need to do. Email me if you need further details.

Hi Mike, thanks for that info.

Can you please tell me if it's possible to use the presets in the OpenSPIM plugin?  For example, can I setup some presets for red channel and green channel and then get OpenSPIM switch between during the acquisition?

Thanks
Neil

The Stradus is not integrated with the Openspim plugin so power cannot be controlled by the slider. You can control the power using micromanager presets: one to turn on the Laser and another to set the power level. I am not sure why you need to turn the laser on before changing the power level, but in my experience that is what you need to do. Email me if you need further details.

Hi all.  I understand this is a very specific area, and as such understand the support for which will be limited.  I'll continue to post my steps and progress for future reference.

I realized that I needed to right click and run the SPIMtestDrive file (newb trying to run the main acquisition part of the code).

It runs, pops up the "Welcome to Micro-Manager" window to fill out my details, after which it throws a "Micro-Manager Error" of:
Error: Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library
Mmcorj.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V

In the output window I see the text pasted below.  I've read that it might be a 32 to 64 bit issue, but not sure how to proceed.  I have JDK 32 and 64 bit installed.  I've tried creating an environment parameter for JAVA_HOME as C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7 as suggested in a really old post, but still no joy.

Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks
Neil

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Running SPIMAcquisition Code in Netbeans

Hi guys,

I've gotten the following installed on the microscope controller PC (fresh Win7 64bit install):
- Netbeans 8.1
- JDK 1.7.0_80 (unchecking the open JRE option, assuming that my JRE 1.8.0_66 is all I need for my browser) (I've installed both 32 and 64 bit versions of both).
-  OpenSPIM-20150427 extracted

I created a GIT account, watched a few tutorials and have the gist for now - I'll come back to that once I get to understanding where I'm going to start making changes.  I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bsh/EvalError at spim.SPIMAcquisition.main(SPIMAcquisition.java:1587)

I've attached the full output window with -e and -X settings in place (sorry if too verbose, I can provide other details if needed).

I thought there might be changes in the master repo, so I performed a pull, and on inspecting the differences it appears some changes has been made, but still I get the same error on running the code.  That's assuming I have incorporated those changes.  Does a pull automatically merge with my original clone?
I'm using the git options via Netbeans.

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil

I don?t think that the Openspim plugin is capable of two channels. If it is I would like to know how. I use the Multidimensional acquisition window from micro-manager to handle my two channel, z stack, time-lapse acquisitions. You set up the channels?red and green? in the configuration settings of micro-manager. The group can be called channels and consists of two presets?red and green. The important parameter for the group is the core shutter. For the red channel it is your green laser and for the green channel it is your blue laser. When you open the multi-dimensional acquisition window there will be a channel section of the window. There is a drop down tab called ?channel group? which you need to specify the channel configuration group that you set up. Then press the new button on the right to add the red and green channels. You can add the color in the table and the exposure time for each channel. It is a really straightforward multi-dimensional acquisition window once you learn how to use it. I hope this helps. I could send you screen shots if necessary.

cheers

This means that it cannot find the DLL that implements the
hardware-specific parts of Micro-Manager.

I believe that you can fix this problem by telling Netbeans to start
SPIMTestDrive with the environment variable PATH adjusted to point to the
directory of your installed Micro-Manager that contains the MMCoreJ.dll
file. I might be wrong, though :-(

Subject: [OpenSPIM] A new type of sharper beam?
Message-ID: <D28DCFB6.72DD%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hi folks,

The following paper struck me as potentially very useful.  It seems that a simple(ish) array of slits in front of the cylinder lens can create a narrow, subdiffraction-sized sheet of light via interference which propagates without broadening.  Kind of a 2D Bessel beam.
"Toward the optical "magic carpet": reducing the divergence of a light sheet below the diffraction limit
In 3D, diffraction-free or Bessel beams are well known and have found applications in diverse fields. An analog in 2D, or pseudonondiffracting (PND) beams, is a nontrivial problem, and existing methods suffer from deficiencies. For example, Airy beams are not highly localized, some PND beams have significant side lobes, and a cosine beam has to be truncated by a very narrow aperture thus discarding most of the energy. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it is possible to generate a quasi-nondiffracting 2D light beam in a simple and efficient fashion. This is achieved by placing a mask consisting of a pair of double slits on a cylindrical lens. The applications include light sheet microscopy/optical sectioning and particle manipulation."

https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-40-21-5121

That sounds like a subdiffraction-width plane that almost anyone could make.  That is interesting to me as the extra complexity and cost of Bessel beams have led me to put off exploring more precise illumination methods for now.  As far as I can tell you just need to fabricate a sufficiently precise mask, and you might need a different mask for each wavelength.  What do you think?

Best,


Tim

Hi all, I hope the science is treating you well.

I have been looking at getting started with getting into the code, which I see is here:
http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/
but I'm a little lost about how to get started, and how to be part of the open source effort vs. just making my own version.

I'm a semi experienced programmer (a little Java, Pascal, C, Matlab, Igor Pro, LabView, NIDAQ to varying levels) and I have all the applications in place (Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio Express 2010, 2015, and all the java SDKs I might need).  Where I get lost is how to incorporate anything I do into the existing code?  What parts should I, can I work on?  Do these changes need to be vetted before being incorporated?  How do I get started with version control?  Etc. etc.  I feel this is, for me, the biggest hurdle in open source coding:  Not being able to code, but being able to 'open source'.  I've always been a lone coder up until this point, so please excuse my ignorance to these details.

Also, I think maybe I'm stuck on the Maven thing.  I see in the README.md that it's Maven, drawing on SciJava, and I can import into Netbeans for example.  Does anybody have any good links to help me get started with that?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Dear Neil,

It is great to have you as a contributor in OpenSPIM.
Simply, you can visit https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition> where all the SPIMAcquisition codes are located.
Jenkins compiles/packages these source codes and upload it to the OpenSPIM update site.

Please, use fork this repository for having your own version of the code. Some git knowledge is required to work with.
When you think your source codes are ready, you can simply create a pull request.
We will evaluate your changes and guide you to merge it to the production master branch.

Please, let me know if you need more help. I will try to help you as much as I can.

Best Regards,
HongKee

What you found here is actually not the source code, but a so-called
"Continuous Integration Server". Essentially it means that this is a web
server that also watches the source code in the background and builds it
whenever it gets updated.

Theoretically, it also runs all the regression tests (i.e. small snippets
of code that verify that what the programmer expected to work, ahem,
actually works). Practically, there is preciously little in the way of
regression tests because the student who wrote most of the SPIMAcquisition
code based a lot of faith in the code he wrote and skipped writing tests.

The only regression test, in fact, was written by HongKee, long after the
original author moved on to other pastures.

As pointed out by HongKee, the source code can be found at

	https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

The most important thing about the source code is that it is in a source
code "repository", i.e. a place where the code can not only be shared, but
contributions can be integrated easily. This is possible by the use of the
version control software called "Git". I encourage you to take 15 minutes
to learn how to use it (and why it improves your life) at:

	https://try.github.com/

More about integrating contributions below.

Good. They all have support for Git (actually, VS Express does not, but VS
2015 does, I am actually working on that ;-)). So all you need to do is
"clone" the repository mentioned above into your workspace.

You can then give the code a test run using the SPIMTestDrive class:

	https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/test/java/SPIMTestDrive.java

> Where I get lost is how to incorporate anything I do into the existing
> code?

Yeah, unfortunately this is my mistake. I was supposed to manage the
student writing the code and I failed to convince him to document things
so that the next person has a chance to dive in, too. So things are pretty
much undocumented.

I do not have enough time to answer questions, but I managed to give
HongKee an introduction into the code base before switching jobs, so maybe
you want to ask concrete questions on this list? (On this list so that the
impact of the answers is maximized and HongKee won't have to repeat
himself.)

> What parts should I, can I work on?

The Open Source idea is that you work on those parts that you need to see
improved. I am sure you have a couple of pet peeves that you would love to
see addressed. Those are good places to start from.

And again, if you have no idea where to start "scratching your itch", just
ask away, on this list.

> Do these changes need to be vetted before being incorporated?

The common process is that you create a copy of the repository on GitHub
(for historical reasons, this is called "forking"). In this copy, you can
do *everything* you like.

Then you will start improving the code. Once you have an improvement you
think is valuable also for others, you open a so-called "Pull Request" on
GitHub:

	https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

HongKee will review the changes, possibly make suggestions how to improve
or otherwise change the code, and eventually "merge" the changes.

Depending how polished you want your contribution to look, you might want
to go to the full distance and follow the advice in:

	https://github.com/maven-nar/nar-maven-plugin/wiki/How-to-contribute

(This is from a related project, but the advice applies to pretty much all
Open Source projects.)

> How do I get started with version control?

My recommendation is https://try.github.com/, but depending how visual you
work, http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/ might be
better. Or read the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. There are
tons of good resources available, my favorite being Git For Teams
(disclaimer: I reviewed this book before publication), but that one will
keep you occupied for a couple of evenings.

You might find it slightly challenging at first, because collaboration
always requires clearer communication than "lone coding", and also the
occasional compromise. I found that this requirement was most challenging
to most scientists, who are basically used (even encouraged!!!) to work
against each other all the time.

The advantage of Open Source coding is that you do not need to duplicate
work. You put in that extra effort to make the code work not only for you,
but for others, and then you can benefit from others' contributions just
the same as they can benefit from yours'.

This concept is very closely related to Isaac Newton's famous words: "If I
could see so far, it was only because I was standing on the shoulders of
giants". It is strange how far away science has deviated from that world
view.

> Also, I think maybe I'm stuck on the Maven thing.

Oh, Maven. Yep, it looks a little complex in the beginning, I agree.

Think of Maven as the system that allows programmers to stand on each
others' shoulders. It allows you to define what other software components
your software depends on ("dependencies"). For example, OpenSPIM depends
on Micro-Manager, which in turn depends on ImageJ. And the closer you
look, the more fine-grained things become. More details can be found here:

	http://imagej.net/Maven

I'll check out all the links, bang my head against a few of the main starting points, and get back to the list once I get rolling.

Message-ID: <CO2PR05MB6819EA9AEFA951A6CD7CC21ECE10@CO2PR05MB681.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi guys,

I've gotten the following installed on the microscope controller PC (fresh Win7 64bit install):
- Netbeans 8.1
- JDK 1.7.0_80 (unchecking the open JRE option, assuming that my JRE 1.8.0_66 is all I need for my browser) (I've installed both 32 and 64 bit versions of both).
-  OpenSPIM-20150427 extracted

I created a GIT account, watched a few tutorials and have the gist for now - I'll come back to that once I get to understanding where I'm going to start making changes.  I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bsh/EvalError
at spim.SPIMAcquisition.main(SPIMAcquisition.java:1587)

I've attached the full output window with -e and -X settings in place (sorry if too verbose, I can provide other details if needed).

I thought there might be changes in the master repo, so I performed a pull, and on inspecting the differences it appears some changes has been made, but still I get the same error on running the code.  That's assuming I have incorporated those changes.  Does a pull automatically merge with my original clone?
I'm using the git options via Netbeans.

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil

Message-ID: <CO2PR05MB681C3681C7F827CCDA4BF8FECE10@CO2PR05MB681.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Has anybody got any experience with the power control slider not working when connected to a Stradus laser over a COM port?  I have made a short unlisted YouTube to show what's happening and save me a few words here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JEiMHxS69w

Key points:

-          I cannot control the power of the active shutter using the power slider - it jumps back to zero

-          When changing through the device controller (which works as it should on the laser itself) it shows what looks like a multiplication factor gone wrong somewhere on the slider.

-          At certain values the slider value jumps back and forth, which is strange

-          It only works for one of the lasers.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Thanks
Neil

The Stradus is not integrated with the Openspim plugin so power cannot be controlled by the slider. You can control the power using micromanager presets: one to turn on the Laser and another to set the power level. I am not sure why you need to turn the laser on before changing the power level, but in my experience that is what you need to do. Email me if you need further details.

Hi Mike, thanks for that info.

Can you please tell me if it's possible to use the presets in the OpenSPIM plugin?  For example, can I setup some presets for red channel and green channel and then get OpenSPIM switch between during the acquisition?

Thanks
Neil

Hi all.  I understand this is a very specific area, and as such understand the support for which will be limited.  I'll continue to post my steps and progress for future reference.

I realized that I needed to right click and run the SPIMtestDrive file (newb trying to run the main acquisition part of the code).

It runs, pops up the "Welcome to Micro-Manager" window to fill out my details, after which it throws a "Micro-Manager Error" of:
Error: Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library
Mmcorj.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V

In the output window I see the text pasted below.  I've read that it might be a 32 to 64 bit issue, but not sure how to proceed.  I have JDK 32 and 64 bit installed.  I've tried creating an environment parameter for JAVA_HOME as C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7 as suggested in a really old post, but still no joy.

Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks
Neil

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Running SPIMAcquisition Code in Netbeans

Hi guys,

I've gotten the following installed on the microscope controller PC (fresh Win7 64bit install):
- Netbeans 8.1
- JDK 1.7.0_80 (unchecking the open JRE option, assuming that my JRE 1.8.0_66 is all I need for my browser) (I've installed both 32 and 64 bit versions of both).
-  OpenSPIM-20150427 extracted

I created a GIT account, watched a few tutorials and have the gist for now - I'll come back to that once I get to understanding where I'm going to start making changes.  I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bsh/EvalError at spim.SPIMAcquisition.main(SPIMAcquisition.java:1587)

I've attached the full output window with -e and -X settings in place (sorry if too verbose, I can provide other details if needed).

I thought there might be changes in the master repo, so I performed a pull, and on inspecting the differences it appears some changes has been made, but still I get the same error on running the code.  That's assuming I have incorporated those changes.  Does a pull automatically merge with my original clone?
I'm using the git options via Netbeans.

Thanks in advance for your time.

I don’t think that the Openspim plugin is capable of two channels. If it is I would like to know how. I use the Multidimensional acquisition window from micro-manager to handle my two channel, z stack, time-lapse acquisitions. You set up the channels—red and green— in the configuration settings of micro-manager. The group can be called channels and consists of two presets—red and green. The important parameter for the group is the core shutter. For the red channel it is your green laser and for the green channel it is your blue laser. When you open the multi-dimensional acquisition window there will be a channel section of the window. There is a drop down tab called “channel group” which you need to specify the channel configuration group that you set up. Then press the new button on the right to add the red and green channels. You can add the color in the table and the exposure time for each channel. It is a really straightforward multi-dimensional acquisition window once you learn how to use it. I hope this helps. I could send you screen shots if necessary.

cheers

I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

This means that it cannot find the DLL that implements the
hardware-specific parts of Micro-Manager.

I believe that you can fix this problem by telling Netbeans to start
SPIMTestDrive with the environment variable PATH adjusted to point to the
directory of your installed Micro-Manager that contains the MMCoreJ.dll
file. I might be wrong, though :-(

Ciao,
Johannes
