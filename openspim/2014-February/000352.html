<PRE>Hi all,

I only forward this because I cannot go do it myself ;-) Please spread the
word, especially to talented microscopers with a programming background
who are awesome (so they fit into the Micro-Manager team).

Ciao,
Johannes

Subject: [micro-manager-general] Position open on the Micro-Manager team

Dear Micro-Manager list members,

We have a Research Specialist Position open on the Micro-Manager team.  We are looking for someone with a strong background in microscopy as well as software coding.  This is a full time position at the Mission Bay campus of UCSF in San Francisco.  If you are interested, please apply through <A HREF="https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/apply/JPF00089.">https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/apply/JPF00089.</A>  If you know someone who may be interested, can you please forward this email?  If you would like more information, please contact us: info at micro-manager.org.

Full text of the job announcement:


A Research Specialist position is open on the Micro-Manager development team.  Micro-Manager (<A HREF="http://micro-manager.org">http://micro-manager.org</A>) is Open Source software for microscope control that is used in thousands of laboratories world-wide and has more than 50 code contributors.  We are looking for a person with strong programming skills (C++, Java), who understands light microscopy (preferably has extensive experience with microscopes), can write documentation, and enjoys helping/teaching scientists work with microscopes.  The Micro-Manager project is part of Ron Vale&#8217;s laboratory at UCSF and has about 2 more years of NIH funding.  We plan to transition Micro-Manager to an independent (possibly non-profit) organization that will continue the core mission of Micro-Manager (to provide open source software tools for microscopists) but be financed more directly by those who benefit from its existence.  The position requires a minimum of a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or equivalent (preferably in life sciences, physics, engineering or computer sciences)  and demonstrable programming experience in Java and/or C++ as well as preferably one or more years experience with scientific imaging using light microscopes.  In addition, the position requires excellent communication skills, great problem-solving abilities, and a detail oriented personality.

To Apply:  Please submit cover letter, CV, and contact information for two professional references to <A HREF="https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/apply/JPF00089.">https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/apply/JPF00089.</A>

UCSF seeks candidates whose experience, teaching, research, or community service has prepared them to contribute to our commitment to diversity and excellence. UCSF is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.


Best regards,


Nico Stuurman
