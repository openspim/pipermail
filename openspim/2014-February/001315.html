</I>
To be clear, my suggestion of LZO was trying to maximize throughput. The
bottleneck is most likely the storage -- even if you would use SSD or a
super-parallel RAID, the data transport between RAM and the storage device
is very, very slow compared to the transport between the RAM and the CPU.

That is why I suggested giving LZO a try: it might very well turn out that
throughput is *higher* because your CPU is unlikely to be highly impacted
by the use of it (I expect it still to be used less than 50% maximum even
if Micro-Manager is recording *and* LZO is used to compress the data
stream) and at the same time, the bottleneck -- the data transport to the
storage device -- is used to the same extent. Only that it would now
transport between 20-50% more data (depending on your exact data, of
course, but should be in that ball park given that fluorescence images
have a histogram very favorable to even simplistic compression).

Ciao,
Johannes
