The self-extracting archive is produced by make-dev-env.sh in the main directory, but I hasten to point out that it doesn't include any of the actual code -- rather, it contains instructions to download the code from github (in fact, the development environment it sets up has the git source code management software very well-integrated.) Github is probably the best way to get the changed code to us, though it would involve deep familiarization with the SCM software (and an account/fork of our project on github to which to upload, followed by a pull request...).

Meanwhile, I added the reference to commons-math3-3.2.jar some time ago, but not on the main openspim branch -- it's there now, so executing 'git pull' will technically bring in that change (but it will probably also create some annoying merge conflicts...).

I suspected this might be the case. The main problem I've had is wanting to be sure that the motors had stopped at the correct position and grabbing a frame there. Continuous drive, as suggested by Michael Webber, makes for an excellent workaround to this concern; however, it has a bit of a shaky standing in the OpenSPIM software at present. There's some issues involved in it that I haven't had the opportunity to sort out yet; given the interest, I'll plan to give it a second look in the future.
