Hello Jan,

We have used both the Coherent CUBE and the OBIS (488ish nm, 50 mW) on
our system, and they work really well... BUT Diode lasers such as these
really do need a clean up filter, as there is a (unfortunately
unmeasurable) bit of parasitic green light in the range of the emission
of GFP/YFP.

Maybe someone from the Huisken lab can chime in to tell you about the use
of the Sapphire, as it does not have the same characteristics as the CUB
or OBIS.

Best regards,

Pete

Hi Jan,

we are using Coherent Sapphire DPSS lasers in some of our setups and cannot complain about the beam quality or spectral properties. The disadvantage is that for best convenience you need an AOTF which you have to buy and align, but you can also go for ND filters once you figured out how much power you really need. As Pete mentioned, there are issues with diode lasers in terms of spectral properties (green background from a 488 nm laser, requires clean up filter), but you can nicely control them over USB. They also tend to be more compact. You will probably end up with a cheaper and more compact system if you go for diode lasers, and with a slightly better performance if you go for DPSS lasers.

Best,
Michael

Subject: [micro-manager-general] Micro-Manager 1.4.15 release schedule

Hi All,

We're planning on releasing 1.4.15 on Monday, September 24.

Since it has been 6 months since our last release (1.4.14), there have
been quite a few new added features, device adapters, and bugfixes. A
list of these will be posted here before or at the time of the
release.

Developers with SVN commit access:

We have not had a formal release schedule/process in the past
(something we might think about in the future), but it is very true
that vastly more people use the release versions, compared to the
nightly builds. If you are thinking of introducing significant new
functionality, it will be best to commit such changes after the
release date, so that advanced users who use the nightly builds will
have a chance to test the new functionality before it goes into the
next release version.

(We feel that 6 months is too long a period between releases, as we
would like to get new features and fixes to users more quickly. We are
considering introducing a semi-regular schedule (quarterly?
bimonthly?) for future releases.)

Best,
The Micro-Manager Team

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the rotational position 4D-Stage
Message-ID: <OF544F1931.0F5C7E35-ONC1257BE5.00448D9D-C1257BE5.00448DA3@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

 Hi dear All,

I have noticed a problem with the rotational axis of the USB 4D-Stage.

When the motor is driven without the belt that transmits the movemente to the sample holder, it
works perfectly. The problem is that when I use the belt to transmit the movement from the motor
to the sample holder, there is a shift in angles between the axis of the motor and the axis of the sample
holder, and every time I perform an angle movement the shift increases. At the same time the position of the
motor  axis is affected causing no repetability when using the belt. So, I  can't position the sample to the exact angle I desire. 

I don't know if the problem of this situation is because the belt is not so tight. I would like to know if some
of you have had this issue and how could you solve it.

I have thought to solve the issue replacing the normal pulleys and belt for timing pulleys and belt or little plastic sprockets and chain
in order to avoid the slipping.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hello Edgar,

A few thoughts on the subject at hand:

- Is the outside diameter of the sample pulley snug into the ball
bearing, or doe is slip?! Maybe you could use some teflon tape to made it
more snug if this is the case.

- How loose or tight is the belt?! Is it an O-ring type belt, or more
like a rubber band?!

- And lastly, how snug is your sample held in the sample pulley?!

Your idea of the timing pulleys and plastic sprocket/chain link isn't a
bad one at all, I'm just not sure if it will be the answer...

Have a great weekend!

Pete

 Hello Peter,

-Yes, the outside diameter is very well attached to the bearing.

-The belt is not so tight but not so loose and it is an O-ring type.
?I just tried using a very tight belt and obtained the same results as 
?with the normal tighten belt. I made the testing using a rubber band as
?well and I obtained a bigger shift (because the material is more elastic).

-About how snug is the sample to the sample holder: I made the test without
?sample. I just stichted a tape with a drawn arrow to each pulley and made the comparison.

I already check all the possibilities that could cause the problem. So
I will try to solve the issue using either a timing belt & pulleys or a little plastic chain & sprockets.
Hopefully it will solve the problem.

Have a nice weekend too.

Kind regards,
Edgar

 Hi dear all,

I would like to add a temperature control to the SPIM chamber, so
I was thinking to build a new SPIM chamber but made of aluminum instead of acrylic
because of the better heat transmission of the aluminum. The think is that I don't
know if the illumination of the sample will be affected (the lightsheet could be reflected
inside the aluminum chamber). Do you think would make sense to to add some glass windows
to the chamber?

Thanks in advance for your comments.
Kind regards,
Edgar

Interesting idea about the temperature control! We had the idea already
but too many other things to do so far.

Regarding the reflection: yes, I would expect the scattered laser light to
provide reason for a lot of problems.

Depending how fast your temperature control needs to react (i.e. do you
need to keep the temperature just stable? In that case, a big peltier
underneath the plexi glass chamber should be good enough), you might need
to anodize the side of the chamber, or put in a window as you say.

Another idea would be to embed the peltier *inside* the chamber rather
than underneath, so that you do not have to go through the complete
centimeter or so of plexi glass.

Also keep in mind that you need to have a precise temperature sensor
inside the chamber, preferably two: one close to the peltier, one as far
from it as possible, to account for temperature gradients.

But please keep in mind, too, that I am a software guy, not a hardware
guy, so hopefully scientists with more experience in the matters at hand
will respond soon (I know that PAvel is at a workshop these days,
introducing the OpenSPIM to yet another crowd of scientists, so he'll be
busy, I suspect).

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

Thanks a lot for your feedback!! 

I think that you mean aluminum, not plexiglas.

I will add glass windows to the chamber then, because it will look
nicer and I think it will be easier to visualize the sample when positioning it
or to illuminate it.

My case is that I need to get a stable temperature, let's say 37 ?C

You're right about the gradients, so I will take that into consideration using
two sensors, only to be sure that I get an uniform tempereture through the
media. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

Interesting idea about the temperature control! We had the idea already
but too many other things to do so far.

Regarding the reflection: yes, I would expect the scattered laser light to
provide reason for a lot of problems.

Depending how fast your temperature control needs to react (i.e. do you
need to keep the temperature just stable? In that case, a big peltier
underneath the plexi glass chamber should be good enough), you might need
to anodize the side of the chamber, or put in a window as you say.

Another idea would be to embed the peltier *inside* the chamber rather
than underneath, so that you do not have to go through the complete
centimeter or so of plexi glass.

Also keep in mind that you need to have a precise temperature sensor
inside the chamber, preferably two: one close to the peltier, one as far
from it as possible, to account for temperature gradients.

But please keep in mind, too, that I am a software guy, not a hardware
guy, so hopefully scientists with more experience in the matters at hand
will respond soon (I know that PAvel is at a workshop these days,
introducing the OpenSPIM to yet another crowd of scientists, so he'll be
busy, I suspect).

Ciao,
Johannes

We tried it with a Peltier, BUT: THe problem is a Peltier is a
Heat-PUMP, not a heater, so one side will be cooled, the other will get
hot. This is convenient for cooling, as you can simply put a big cooler
or a water-tube on the hot side to remove the heat (the efficiency
mostly depends on the temperature gradient over the Peltier). For
heating you have the problem that you have to get the heat somehow TO
the war side: A water-tube might again be a good solution, but as long
as you only want to heat, a simple resistor is much easier:
1. controling it with a microcontroller or a computer is very simple
(for a Peltier you need much more electronics here)
2. you don't need to worry about the heat-pump-thing, as the resistor
with resitance R and current I will simply have a heating power of
P=R*I^2 (or if you use PWM with a duty cycle p: P=U^2*p^2/R)

Yes that's really true: We use one PT100 close to the resistor which is
used for a PI loop and a second one inside the sample chamber to measure
the medium temperature. Typically we set the set point ~1?C above the
desired final temperature. We use PT100 with a 4-wire readout, which is
very precise.

Here are some links on PT100 and Peltier-temperature control:

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8YTHqT_H2Go3tSy_uX51uKkzeHm0j4uGZ8m68Awa7guoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm running into a problem when I try to configure my 4D stage.  If I
configure using the January 31 2013 OpenSPIM download, without updating
through the website first, the Picard stage loads and works normally.
However once I run the update, the stage can't be found (I get the error
message, "OpenSPIM Unable to load library: file not accessible or
corrupted," and it appears as "Picard stage (unavailable)" in the hardware
configuration wizard list of devices. Has anyone else had this problem?
Also, the MicroManager version changes to 1.4.x dev after I run the
updater; is that as it should be?  I would simply not update, except that I
need to do so for my camera to be recognized.

A second question: is there any possibility or plan for the OpenSPIM
software to be made compatible with Windows 7?  I can't acquire a new
computer and run XP on it anymore, as our computing department won't
purchase XP now that it's not supported.  I'm using an older machine with
XP now, to set up, but I suspect it will be inadequate once I'm acquiring
real data sets.

Thanks,
Aurelia

Simply not updating will only delay problems, not fix them.

As to the concrete driver problem, I suspect that it is due to us renaming
the OpenSPIM device adapter to PicardStage. You see, the stage is only
part of the OpenSPIM, and we do want to be able to exchange the stage for
another one whenever needed, so the driver was misnamed.

Unfortunately, this invalidates hardware configurations made with the
Jan31 build. You will have to redo the configuration from scratch (or load
it with a Jan31 build, remove the stage from the configuration, save, load
in a current build, and add the new stage).

Sorry for the inconvenience! If I had seen any other way that would not
have caused us a mountain of problems in the future, I would have gone
that way.

Based on feedback from other users, it appears that the OpenSPIM software
should run on Windows 7 just fine, including the camera driver (which was
previously a problem: Hamamatsu's driver had serious problems with Windows
7).

You will just neeed to make sure that you install the newest DCAM driver
from Hamamatsu (I wish they would allow us to ship hardware drivers with
our software; as it is, installation of OpenSPIM is unnecessarily
inconvenient: you have to install the DCAM driver in an extra step after
or before downloading the OpenSPIM software package). But given that the
computer would be new, you would download the newest DCAM driver anyway...

Ciao,
Johannes

The error message itself is expected now; the old mmgr_dal_OpenSPIM.dll file is deprecated (meaning when you update, it deletes that file). As Johannes explained, you'll need to re-make the configuration file to use the new device adapter.


In the list of devices, is there also a 'PicardStage' subtree you can see? If so, the devices there should be used instead of those under OpenSPIM. Once your configuration files no longer try to use OpenSPIM, 


If not (which is what the "(unavailable)" seems to be indicating), please make sure that the PiUsb.dll file exists in the same directory as mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll (which should be, from the ImageJ/Fiji directory, in "mm/win32/"). If this file is missing for some reason, running the Fiji Updater might restore it.


If the above doesn't help solve the problem, you can try using the Fiji Updater's advanced mode: After launching the updater, click "Advanced Mode". At the top of the window is "View Options:" -- set it to "View files of the 'OpenSPIM' site". In the list of files, look for "mm/win32/PiUsb.dll". The second column should show the status of that file: "Up-to-date" or perhaps "Not installed". If the file is marked as "Not installed" or "Update available", clicking on that text should allow you to set it to "Install / Update"; from there, clicking "Apply Changes" will install the missing file. (If the file is marked as "Up-to-date", then some other problem is making the PicardStage adapter unavailable -- please let me know if this is the case.)


> Also, the MicroManager version changes to 1.4.x dev after I run the updater; is that as it should be? I would simply not update, except that I need to do so for my camera to be recognized. 
The change in Micro-Manager version is also expected; part of the recent updates was to switch to a newer version of the underlying Micro-Manager code.



> A second question: is there any possibility or plan for the OpenSPIM software to be made compatible with Windows 7? I can&#39;t acquire a new computer and run XP on it anymore, as our computing department won&#39;t purchase XP now that it&#39;s not supported. I&#39;m using an older machine with XP now, to set up, but I suspect it will be inadequate once I&#39;m acquiring real data sets. 
As Johannes pointed out, this may already be possible provided the latest DCAM driver is used. There are plans to make Windows 7 officially supported in the future.



Please let me know if this doesn't help solve the problem!

 Dear Jan,

Thanks for your feedback. So I will use the TO22 housing resistor 
and the PT100 temperature sensor. Or maybe instead of the 
TO22 housing resistor I will use a heating foil (also a resistor).

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hello,

Thank you very much!  On re-updating Fiji this morning, the stage issue has
resolved - PicardStage appears and is available for configuration.  I am
now all set except that my camera (I am using a Photometrics one rather
than the Hamamatsu, so I added the PVCAM dll file) is able to load and snap
images, but times out when I try to use the live view.   Has anyone seen a
similar issue, or happen to have any suggestions for fixing this?

Thanks again,
Aurelia

http://www.auberins.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=14

but I don't know if these kind of controllers are suitable for our application.

The advantage of this ones is that I wouldn't need to build the circuit for conditioning the
signal for the PT100 sensor and avoid writting a program for controlling the temperature.
So the temperature control would be independent.

What's your opinion?

Hi!

I'm attatching a picture of our chamber ... if that helps ;-) ... Have 
you already decided on a temperature controller? As I mentioned before, 
we have a homebuilt one and I'm using these PT100 to embed into the 
sample chamber:

For measurement in the chamber I found thin PT100 from stainless steel:

Hi Edgar,

I recommend to not use aluminum as material for the chamber, as it is very sensitive to salt. As soon as you use medium containing salt (fish medium, PBS etc.) the surface will oxidize sooner or later and you will run into problems. You can coat/paint/anodize the aluminum but this will not last forever. The best would be to use stainless steel like in the Zeiss Lightsheet Z1, but at least our workshop has no suitable machines to build a chamber from stainless steel. If you want to use a peltier or a similar device I would try to build a "two component" chamber: a thin-walled plastic chamber, enclosed by an aluminum "cage" on the outside. Another possibility is to use a all-plastic chamber with an external perfusion system, that's how I do it. The main drawback is that you have water flowing in your chamber, which could disturb your imaging, that's why I use FEP tubes as a solid support for the specimen.

Best,
Michael

 Dear Jan,

I already read the manual of the PID temperature controller and also has Solid State Relay output. When using the proportional
control mode, the output is a kind of a on-off switching, but controlling the percentage of time the output is on and off for every cicle.

"Proportional controls are designed to eliminate the cycling associated with on/off control. A proportional controller
decreases the average power being supplied to the heater as the temperature approaches setpoint.
This has the effect of slowing down the heater so that it will not overshoot the setpoint, but will approach the setpoint
and maintain a stable temperature. This proportioning action can be accomplished by turning the output on and off for 
short intervals. This &#8220;time proportioning&#8221; varies the ratio of &#8220;on&#8221; time to &#8220;off&#8221; time to control the temperature".

Since my aim is to integrate the temperature control in the easier way I will use this PID temperature controller and
the PT100 sensor. 

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: AW: Temperature control for the SPIM chamber

Dear Edgar!

I would opt for the third one, as the first two will only do on-off regulation. The third one has a proper PID loop and the temperature will be more stable. Also it has an input for 3-wire PT100 (the others only NTCs), which is by far more exact and has wire-length correction, so you will have a very accurate temperature measurement. What I'm not so sure about (but also have no experience): It also seems to have a relais (i.e. on-off switching) ?as output, not a linear output, so the regulator will heat in pulses, not continuously ... but maybe that won't harm, as you heat a lot of metal anyways, which will maybe damp away such pulses ;-)

I built my own controller ... but more out of interest, as the cost is more in the EUR100 range + work ;-)
It has a 4-wire PT100 input and a microcontroller + display + USB for control. The output is a MOSFET that can directly drive a resistor for heating with a PWM signal, so it can also provide a little heating power to keep a given temperature. The pro-side is that our SPIM-control software can control the device over USB and log the temperature during any measurement. The down side: the circuit is a little complicated and the PCBs carry a lot of standard SMD parts (which are not so easy to solder for non-experienced people).

I have seen that there are on internet some temperature controllers for ca. $25

 Dear Michael,

Thanks for your recommendation about the oxidation of the Aluminum, I was searching on Internet about that
but I didn't find anything concrete. I have to ask first in the workshop here in the Institute if it is possible
to machine Stainless Steel. 
Could I ask why you use a perfusion system in the SPIM chamber? Is it for changing the media constantly?

Kind regards,
Edgar

 Dear Johannes Schindelin and dear Luke Stuyvenberg,

I am having the same issue as Aurelia, as long as I update Fiji, I am not able
to configure the Picard Stage, it appears as PicardStage(unavailable). At the
same time I am using a The Imaging Source Camera, also the camera appears as
TIScam(unavailable). So I have been working with the no updated version of Fiji.

I already follow all the steps provided in the previous mails in order to solve this issue,
but for me didn't have any effect. I am still not able to configure the devices after the updating.

I would like to know what else could be done.

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Do you find any hint in the CoreLog file what might cause it to be
unavailable?

Hmm. That is not very verbose now, is it...? ;-)

The best bet I have is to download http://www.dependencywalker.com/ and
open OpenSPIM.app/mm/win32/mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll with it, to find out which
dependencies it is missing.

Hi Johannes,

Normally the files from the The Imaging Source camera needed to work with ?Manager are 
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll (which in turn requires TIS_DShowLib09.dll)

http://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/TIScam

When I opened the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the no-updated version there were
no dependencies missing and of course the file TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll was on the list.

As long as I opened the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version there was
a dependency missing: TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll

So, maybe the problem is that the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version is
retrieving TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll but this file actually must be TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll


I just rename the file to TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll, then I didn't have dependencies missing when
opening the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll


When starting the hardware configuration wizard from ?Manager, TIScam was available but as long
as I add the device and click OK, ?Manager suddenly closes :-/


So I think the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dllmmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version should be re-programmed but I don't know how
to do it and if it is such a complicated task.

 Hi Johannes,

I found that the problem about the Picard Stage was because there were two dependencies missing:
MSVCP100D.dll and MSVCR100D.dll



I just downloaded this files from internet and copied to C:\WINDOWS\system32 and now I am able to use the Picard Stage
using the updated version of Fiji.

Now the only issue left is about the camera.

Kind regards,
Edgar

As luck has it, I gave a talk in Mark's group last Thursday. They also
gave me a quite thorough introduction into their OPT setup. With a little
bit of hardware design, we should be able to make a custom "OpenOPT", i.e.
adapting OpenSPIM for OPT imaging. The biggest problem is that we'd need
at least 400 rotation steps, better something like 1200 (or a very fast
camera and a continuous, low-speed rotation). I am not quite sure how we
could get that, probably we'd need to contact Picard systems.

The good news is that almost all the software required to reconstruct the
3D images from the projections is Open Source, i.e. it is accessible and
adaptable.

Ciao,
Dscho

Hi Edgar and everyone,

With regards to the DLL problems that recent updates have generated:
- It seems I accidentally built PicardStage in debug mode (hence the 'D' on the end of the DLL names it became dependent on) -- I've since fixed that issue, uploaded the correct version of the DLL, and taken steps to ensure it won't happen again.
- The troubles with TIScam (and some other device adapters) was an artifact of our Visual Studio upgrade: the device adapters became dependent on the '100' (VS2010) versions of the files. Since Micro-Manager does not yet come bundled with the VS2010 runtime environment, most users will be missing those files. I've fixed these issues and uploaded correct versions to the update site as well.
If you are having trouble with device adapters not loading, please try updating through Fiji again and let me know if the problems persist.

I strongly recommend against downloading and installing DLLs from the internet unless they are from the authoritative source (in the case of these 'MSVC' files, Microsoft) -- I would suggest instead downloading the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package --?http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555?for 32-bit computers?-- which contains the necessary files.


Sorry about all the trouble! If there are any more problems, please e-mail Johannes, myself, and/or the list.


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Luke,

I have updated Fiji and now I am able to configure the Camera and the Picard Stage, thanks a lot.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar and everyone,

With regards to the DLL problems that recent updates have generated:
- It seems I accidentally built PicardStage in debug mode (hence the 'D' on the end of the DLL names it became dependent on) -- I've since fixed that issue, uploaded the correct version of the DLL, and taken steps to ensure it won't happen again.
- The troubles with TIScam (and some other device adapters) was an artifact of our Visual Studio upgrade: the device adapters became dependent on the '100' (VS2010) versions of the files. Since Micro-Manager does not yet come bundled with the VS2010 runtime environment, most users will be missing those files. I've fixed these issues and uploaded correct versions to the update site as well.
If you are having trouble with device adapters not loading, please try updating through Fiji again and let me know if the problems persist.

I strongly recommend against downloading and installing DLLs from the internet unless they are from the authoritative source (in the case of these 'MSVC' files, Microsoft) -- I would suggest instead downloading the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package --?http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555?for 32-bit computers?-- which contains the necessary files.


Sorry about all the trouble! If there are any more problems, please e-mail Johannes, myself, and/or the list.


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8Yb=UOBdEFUB+b+HAoE2UzHVa9BfHhs3CYTnyFAd1BHfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Thanks for this latest update: it has almost fixed my PVCAM problem.  Now I
can load the camera, and since the last update I no longer get a time-out
error message when I use the live view.  But, the live window opens and
displays an image, then it doesn't refresh, so I see the same image until I
stop and start live view again.  I can now run the Open SPIM plugin, but
have to keep stopping and starting live view in order to see what is going
on with my calibration sample.  I'm so close!  Any suggestions for fixing
this?  Live view through my camera works fine in a plain, non-Fiji and
non-OpenSPIM installation of Micromanager, so I can align and take pictures
at the moment, but I want to use your lovely plugin.

And another thing... I remember some discussion from earlier this summer
about optimizing the optics.  I have made a light sheet that's about 10
microns thick, minimizing its thickness by adjusting the second telescope
lens as described on the website.  Can I get it thinner than that?  What
should I move to do so?

Thanks again,

Aurelia

If I remember correctly, this was a bug in upstream uManager that has been
fixed in the meantime. It will take a little while to synchronize our
patches with the upstream source code, but after that, the problem should
be gone!

Johannes

Yes, I seem to remember other reports of this trouble (also with PVCAM, 
if I recall correctly), though I had thought them resolved... I believe 
Johannes is correct, and synchronizing with Micro-Manager may resolve 
this issue. I've started work on this, but the process is 
(frustratingly) intricate, and might take some time. In the future I 
hope to make the process unnecessary.

As a temporary measure, you should have no trouble using the PVCAM 
device adapter from the Micro-Manager nightly build (The file should be 
wherever you installed the 'vanilla' Micro-Manager to; simply copy it to 
OpenSPIM's "mm/win32" directory -- it may ask you to overwrite). If you 
decide to try this, please let me know how it works out.

Thanks,
Luke

 Dear Luke,

I have an issue when clicking the button "Stack at this Z plus", it simply doesn't work.
I have noticed when I press the button and then release it, the button
remains pressed and of course there is no row added to the Position List.

I tried with the option "Insert Current Position" and it works. 

As I can remember I never had this issue using the no-updated version of Fiji.

I don't know if anyone is having the same problem?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Perfect, the 26 September nightly build version of the PVCAM adapter has
cleared up my live view problem!  Thanks very much, I am so happy!

This looks like a dead lock to me. Could you please install a JDK 6, call
the included JVisualVM, attach to the Fiji (or ImageJ) proess and look at
the thread dump whether it says something along the lines "dead lock
detected between thread 2 and 17)?

If you find that information, posting this thread dump as a reply-to-all
of this mail would be incredibly helpful...

Thanks,
Johannes

Hi Edgar,

It sounds as though an exception is being generated and then (very quietly) ignored -- it may show up in a core log, though; could you see about attaching it?

Hi Johannes & Luke,

Sorry for the late reply, it was a little bit hard to understand the instructions about
finding the "dead lock" since I am not a programming guy :-/. It is the first time
I do that.

I already look through the lines of the threaddump and I didn't find anything like
"dead lock detected between thread 2 and 17" so, is there something else
I could do in order to find a solution to this?

I will continue on monday, have a nice weekend and thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Edgar

This looks like a dead lock to me. Could you please install a JDK 6, call
the included JVisualVM, attach to the Fiji (or ImageJ) proess and look at
the thread dump whether it says something along the lines "dead lock
detected between thread 2 and 17)?

If you find that information, posting this thread dump as a reply-to-all
of this mail would be incredibly helpful...

Thanks,
Johannes

Have you taken the thread dump after pressing that button that gets stuck?
How about posting the thread dump here?

Ciao,

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody has any CAD files (or any other 3D files for 
that matter: Maya, 3DS Max, Blender etc.) of the complete setup.  It 
would be great to get a feel for what's happening on the breadboard 
during my planning stages.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Hi all,

in the same spirit as Pavel reported about the Open Access OPT, here are
two projects using lego to build AFMs:

 Hi Johannes,

Now I have taken the threaddump after pressing the button that gets stuck
and I didn't find anything about a dead lock.

Anyway I post the threaddump here, maybe you can find something since I
really don't what every line means.

Have you taken the thread dump after pressing that button that gets stuck?
How about posting the thread dump here?

Why not upload the files as Open Source, in a standard format such as
Wavefront .obj? If the Wiki refuses, please let me know, I *am* able to
fix some problems ;-)

Hello Jan,

We have used both the Coherent CUBE and the OBIS (488ish nm, 50 mW) on
our system, and they work really well... BUT Diode lasers such as these
really do need a clean up filter, as there is a (unfortunately
unmeasurable) bit of parasitic green light in the range of the emission
of GFP/YFP.

Maybe someone from the Huisken lab can chime in to tell you about the use
of the Sapphire, as it does not have the same characteristics as the CUB
or OBIS.

Best regards,

Pete

Hi Jan,

we are using Coherent Sapphire DPSS lasers in some of our setups and cannot complain about the beam quality or spectral properties. The disadvantage is that for best convenience you need an AOTF which you have to buy and align, but you can also go for ND filters once you figured out how much power you really need. As Pete mentioned, there are issues with diode lasers in terms of spectral properties (green background from a 488 nm laser, requires clean up filter), but you can nicely control them over USB. They also tend to be more compact. You will probably end up with a cheaper and more compact system if you go for diode lasers, and with a slightly better performance if you go for DPSS lasers.

Best,
Michael

Subject: [micro-manager-general] Micro-Manager 1.4.15 release schedule

Hi All,

We're planning on releasing 1.4.15 on Monday, September 24.

Since it has been 6 months since our last release (1.4.14), there have
been quite a few new added features, device adapters, and bugfixes. A
list of these will be posted here before or at the time of the
release.

Developers with SVN commit access:

We have not had a formal release schedule/process in the past
(something we might think about in the future), but it is very true
that vastly more people use the release versions, compared to the
nightly builds. If you are thinking of introducing significant new
functionality, it will be best to commit such changes after the
release date, so that advanced users who use the nightly builds will
have a chance to test the new functionality before it goes into the
next release version.

(We feel that 6 months is too long a period between releases, as we
would like to get new features and fixes to users more quickly. We are
considering introducing a semi-regular schedule (quarterly?
bimonthly?) for future releases.)

Best,
The Micro-Manager Team

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the rotational position 4D-Stage
Message-ID: <OF544F1931.0F5C7E35-ONC1257BE5.00448D9D-C1257BE5.00448DA3@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

 Hi dear All,

I have noticed a problem with the rotational axis of the USB 4D-Stage.

When the motor is driven without the belt that transmits the movemente to the sample holder, it
works perfectly. The problem is that when I use the belt to transmit the movement from the motor
to the sample holder, there is a shift in angles between the axis of the motor and the axis of the sample
holder, and every time I perform an angle movement the shift increases. At the same time the position of the
motor  axis is affected causing no repetability when using the belt. So, I  can't position the sample to the exact angle I desire. 

I don't know if the problem of this situation is because the belt is not so tight. I would like to know if some
of you have had this issue and how could you solve it.

I have thought to solve the issue replacing the normal pulleys and belt for timing pulleys and belt or little plastic sprockets and chain
in order to avoid the slipping.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hello Edgar,

A few thoughts on the subject at hand:

- Is the outside diameter of the sample pulley snug into the ball
bearing, or doe is slip?! Maybe you could use some teflon tape to made it
more snug if this is the case.

- How loose or tight is the belt?! Is it an O-ring type belt, or more
like a rubber band?!

- And lastly, how snug is your sample held in the sample pulley?!

Your idea of the timing pulleys and plastic sprocket/chain link isn't a
bad one at all, I'm just not sure if it will be the answer...

Have a great weekend!

Pete

 Hello Peter,

-Yes, the outside diameter is very well attached to the bearing.

-The belt is not so tight but not so loose and it is an O-ring type.
 I just tried using a very tight belt and obtained the same results as 
 with the normal tighten belt. I made the testing using a rubber band as
 well and I obtained a bigger shift (because the material is more elastic).

-About how snug is the sample to the sample holder: I made the test without
 sample. I just stichted a tape with a drawn arrow to each pulley and made the comparison.

I already check all the possibilities that could cause the problem. So
I will try to solve the issue using either a timing belt & pulleys or a little plastic chain & sprockets.
Hopefully it will solve the problem.

Have a nice weekend too.

Kind regards,
Edgar

 Hi dear all,

I would like to add a temperature control to the SPIM chamber, so
I was thinking to build a new SPIM chamber but made of aluminum instead of acrylic
because of the better heat transmission of the aluminum. The think is that I don't
know if the illumination of the sample will be affected (the lightsheet could be reflected
inside the aluminum chamber). Do you think would make sense to to add some glass windows
to the chamber?

Thanks in advance for your comments.
Kind regards,
Edgar

Interesting idea about the temperature control! We had the idea already
but too many other things to do so far.

Regarding the reflection: yes, I would expect the scattered laser light to
provide reason for a lot of problems.

Depending how fast your temperature control needs to react (i.e. do you
need to keep the temperature just stable? In that case, a big peltier
underneath the plexi glass chamber should be good enough), you might need
to anodize the side of the chamber, or put in a window as you say.

Another idea would be to embed the peltier *inside* the chamber rather
than underneath, so that you do not have to go through the complete
centimeter or so of plexi glass.

Also keep in mind that you need to have a precise temperature sensor
inside the chamber, preferably two: one close to the peltier, one as far
from it as possible, to account for temperature gradients.

But please keep in mind, too, that I am a software guy, not a hardware
guy, so hopefully scientists with more experience in the matters at hand
will respond soon (I know that PAvel is at a workshop these days,
introducing the OpenSPIM to yet another crowd of scientists, so he'll be
busy, I suspect).

Hi Johannes,

Thanks a lot for your feedback!! 

I think that you mean aluminum, not plexiglas.

I will add glass windows to the chamber then, because it will look
nicer and I think it will be easier to visualize the sample when positioning it
or to illuminate it.

My case is that I need to get a stable temperature, let's say 37 °C

You're right about the gradients, so I will take that into consideration using
two sensors, only to be sure that I get an uniform tempereture through the
media. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

We tried it with a Peltier, BUT: THe problem is a Peltier is a
Heat-PUMP, not a heater, so one side will be cooled, the other will get
hot. This is convenient for cooling, as you can simply put a big cooler
or a water-tube on the hot side to remove the heat (the efficiency
mostly depends on the temperature gradient over the Peltier). For
heating you have the problem that you have to get the heat somehow TO
the war side: A water-tube might again be a good solution, but as long
as you only want to heat, a simple resistor is much easier:
1. controling it with a microcontroller or a computer is very simple
(for a Peltier you need much more electronics here)
2. you don't need to worry about the heat-pump-thing, as the resistor
with resitance R and current I will simply have a heating power of
P=R*I^2 (or if you use PWM with a duty cycle p: P=U^2*p^2/R)

Yes that's really true: We use one PT100 close to the resistor which is
used for a PI loop and a second one inside the sample chamber to measure
the medium temperature. Typically we set the set point ~1°C above the
desired final temperature. We use PT100 with a 4-wire readout, which is
very precise.

Here are some links on PT100 and Peltier-temperature control:

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8YTHqT_H2Go3tSy_uX51uKkzeHm0j4uGZ8m68Awa7guoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm running into a problem when I try to configure my 4D stage.  If I
configure using the January 31 2013 OpenSPIM download, without updating
through the website first, the Picard stage loads and works normally.
However once I run the update, the stage can't be found (I get the error
message, "OpenSPIM Unable to load library: file not accessible or
corrupted," and it appears as "Picard stage (unavailable)" in the hardware
configuration wizard list of devices. Has anyone else had this problem?
Also, the MicroManager version changes to 1.4.x dev after I run the
updater; is that as it should be?  I would simply not update, except that I
need to do so for my camera to be recognized.

A second question: is there any possibility or plan for the OpenSPIM
software to be made compatible with Windows 7?  I can't acquire a new
computer and run XP on it anymore, as our computing department won't
purchase XP now that it's not supported.  I'm using an older machine with
XP now, to set up, but I suspect it will be inadequate once I'm acquiring
real data sets.

Thanks,
Aurelia

Simply not updating will only delay problems, not fix them.

As to the concrete driver problem, I suspect that it is due to us renaming
the OpenSPIM device adapter to PicardStage. You see, the stage is only
part of the OpenSPIM, and we do want to be able to exchange the stage for
another one whenever needed, so the driver was misnamed.

Unfortunately, this invalidates hardware configurations made with the
Jan31 build. You will have to redo the configuration from scratch (or load
it with a Jan31 build, remove the stage from the configuration, save, load
in a current build, and add the new stage).

Sorry for the inconvenience! If I had seen any other way that would not
have caused us a mountain of problems in the future, I would have gone
that way.

Based on feedback from other users, it appears that the OpenSPIM software
should run on Windows 7 just fine, including the camera driver (which was
previously a problem: Hamamatsu's driver had serious problems with Windows
7).

You will just neeed to make sure that you install the newest DCAM driver
from Hamamatsu (I wish they would allow us to ship hardware drivers with
our software; as it is, installation of OpenSPIM is unnecessarily
inconvenient: you have to install the DCAM driver in an extra step after
or before downloading the OpenSPIM software package). But given that the
computer would be new, you would download the newest DCAM driver anyway...

Ciao,
Johannes

The error message itself is expected now; the old mmgr_dal_OpenSPIM.dll file is deprecated (meaning when you update, it deletes that file). As Johannes explained, you'll need to re-make the configuration file to use the new device adapter.


In the list of devices, is there also a 'PicardStage' subtree you can see? If so, the devices there should be used instead of those under OpenSPIM. Once your configuration files no longer try to use OpenSPIM, 


If not (which is what the "(unavailable)" seems to be indicating), please make sure that the PiUsb.dll file exists in the same directory as mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll (which should be, from the ImageJ/Fiji directory, in "mm/win32/"). If this file is missing for some reason, running the Fiji Updater might restore it.


If the above doesn't help solve the problem, you can try using the Fiji Updater's advanced mode: After launching the updater, click "Advanced Mode". At the top of the window is "View Options:" -- set it to "View files of the 'OpenSPIM' site". In the list of files, look for "mm/win32/PiUsb.dll". The second column should show the status of that file: "Up-to-date" or perhaps "Not installed". If the file is marked as "Not installed" or "Update available", clicking on that text should allow you to set it to "Install / Update"; from there, clicking "Apply Changes" will install the missing file. (If the file is marked as "Up-to-date", then some other problem is making the PicardStage adapter unavailable -- please let me know if this is the case.)


> Also, the MicroManager version changes to 1.4.x dev after I run the updater; is that as it should be? I would simply not update, except that I need to do so for my camera to be recognized. 
The change in Micro-Manager version is also expected; part of the recent updates was to switch to a newer version of the underlying Micro-Manager code.



> A second question: is there any possibility or plan for the OpenSPIM software to be made compatible with Windows 7? I can&#39;t acquire a new computer and run XP on it anymore, as our computing department won&#39;t purchase XP now that it&#39;s not supported. I&#39;m using an older machine with XP now, to set up, but I suspect it will be inadequate once I&#39;m acquiring real data sets. 
As Johannes pointed out, this may already be possible provided the latest DCAM driver is used. There are plans to make Windows 7 officially supported in the future.



Please let me know if this doesn't help solve the problem!


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

 Dear Jan,

Thanks for your feedback. So I will use the TO22 housing resistor 
and the PT100 temperature sensor. Or maybe instead of the 
TO22 housing resistor I will use a heating foil (also a resistor).

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hello,

Thank you very much!  On re-updating Fiji this morning, the stage issue has
resolved - PicardStage appears and is available for configuration.  I am
now all set except that my camera (I am using a Photometrics one rather
than the Hamamatsu, so I added the PVCAM dll file) is able to load and snap
images, but times out when I try to use the live view.   Has anyone seen a
similar issue, or happen to have any suggestions for fixing this?

Thanks again,
Aurelia

Dear Jan,

Thanks a lot for the information, it is very helpful.

I have seen that there are on internet some temperature controllers for ca. $25 
http://www.ebay.de/itm/All-purpose-Temperature-Controller-STC-1000-Whit-sensor-/320628773067
http://www.autospeed.com/cms/A_112617/article.html

or this one that looks more complex
http://www.auberins.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=14

but I don't know if these kind of controllers are suitable for our application.

The advantage of this ones is that I wouldn't need to build the circuit for conditioning the
signal for the PT100 sensor and avoid writting a program for controlling the temperature.
So the temperature control would be independent.

What's your opinion?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi!

I'm attatching a picture of our chamber ... if that helps ;-) ... Have 
you already decided on a temperature controller? As I mentioned before, 
we have a homebuilt one and I'm using these PT100 to embed into the 
sample chamber:

For measurement in the chamber I found thin PT100 from stainless steel:

... but they are rather expensive (~55EUR+VAT)

About the foil: The ones I found a few years ago were all very large ...

Hi Edgar,

I recommend to not use aluminum as material for the chamber, as it is very sensitive to salt. As soon as you use medium containing salt (fish medium, PBS etc.) the surface will oxidize sooner or later and you will run into problems. You can coat/paint/anodize the aluminum but this will not last forever. The best would be to use stainless steel like in the Zeiss Lightsheet Z1, but at least our workshop has no suitable machines to build a chamber from stainless steel. If you want to use a peltier or a similar device I would try to build a "two component" chamber: a thin-walled plastic chamber, enclosed by an aluminum "cage" on the outside. Another possibility is to use a all-plastic chamber with an external perfusion system, that's how I do it. The main drawback is that you have water flowing in your chamber, which could disturb your imaging, that's why I use FEP tubes as a solid support for the specimen.

Best,
Michael

 Dear Jan,

I already read the manual of the PID temperature controller and also has Solid State Relay output. When using the proportional
control mode, the output is a kind of a on-off switching, but controlling the percentage of time the output is on and off for every cicle.

"Proportional controls are designed to eliminate the cycling associated with on/off control. A proportional controller
decreases the average power being supplied to the heater as the temperature approaches setpoint.
This has the effect of slowing down the heater so that it will not overshoot the setpoint, but will approach the setpoint
and maintain a stable temperature. This proportioning action can be accomplished by turning the output on and off for 
short intervals. This &#8220;time proportioning&#8221; varies the ratio of &#8220;on&#8221; time to &#8220;off&#8221; time to control the temperature".

Since my aim is to integrate the temperature control in the easier way I will use this PID temperature controller and
the PT100 sensor. 

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: AW: Temperature control for the SPIM chamber

Dear Edgar!

I would opt for the third one, as the first two will only do on-off regulation. The third one has a proper PID loop and the temperature will be more stable. Also it has an input for 3-wire PT100 (the others only NTCs), which is by far more exact and has wire-length correction, so you will have a very accurate temperature measurement. What I'm not so sure about (but also have no experience): It also seems to have a relais (i.e. on-off switching)  as output, not a linear output, so the regulator will heat in pulses, not continuously ... but maybe that won't harm, as you heat a lot of metal anyways, which will maybe damp away such pulses ;-)

I built my own controller ... but more out of interest, as the cost is more in the EUR100 range + work ;-)
It has a 4-wire PT100 input and a microcontroller + display + USB for control. The output is a MOSFET that can directly drive a resistor for heating with a PWM signal, so it can also provide a little heating power to keep a given temperature. The pro-side is that our SPIM-control software can control the device over USB and log the temperature during any measurement. The down side: the circuit is a little complicated and the PCBs carry a lot of standard SMD parts (which are not so easy to solder for non-experienced people).

 Dear Michael,

Thanks for your recommendation about the oxidation of the Aluminum, I was searching on Internet about that
but I didn't find anything concrete. I have to ask first in the workshop here in the Institute if it is possible
to machine Stainless Steel. 
Could I ask why you use a perfusion system in the SPIM chamber? Is it for changing the media constantly?

Kind regards,
Edgar

 Dear Johannes Schindelin and dear Luke Stuyvenberg,

I am having the same issue as Aurelia, as long as I update Fiji, I am not able
to configure the Picard Stage, it appears as PicardStage(unavailable). At the
same time I am using a The Imaging Source Camera, also the camera appears as
TIScam(unavailable). So I have been working with the no updated version of Fiji.

I already follow all the steps provided in the previous mails in order to solve this issue,
but for me didn't have any effect. I am still not able to configure the devices after the updating.

I would like to know what else could be done.

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Do you find any hint in the CoreLog file what might cause it to be
unavailable?

Hmm. That is not very verbose now, is it...? ;-)

The best bet I have is to download http://www.dependencywalker.com/ and
open OpenSPIM.app/mm/win32/mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll with it, to find out which
dependencies it is missing.

Hi Johannes,

Normally the files from the The Imaging Source camera needed to work with µManager are 
TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll (which in turn requires TIS_DShowLib09.dll)

http://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/TIScam

When I opened the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the no-updated version there were
no dependencies missing and of course the file TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll was on the list.

As long as I opened the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version there was
a dependency missing: TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll

So, maybe the problem is that the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version is
retrieving TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll but this file actually must be TIS_UDSHL09_vc9.dll


I just rename the file to TIS_UDSHL09_vc10.dll, then I didn't have dependencies missing when
opening the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dll


When starting the hardware configuration wizard from µManager, TIScam was available but as long
as I add the device and click OK, µManager suddenly closes :-/


So I think the mmgr_dal_TISCam.dllmmgr_dal_TISCam.dll from the updated version should be re-programmed but I don't know how
to do it and if it is such a complicated task.

 Hi Johannes,

I found that the problem about the Picard Stage was because there were two dependencies missing:
MSVCP100D.dll and MSVCR100D.dll



I just downloaded this files from internet and copied to C:\WINDOWS\system32 and now I am able to use the Picard Stage
using the updated version of Fiji.

Now the only issue left is about the camera.

Kind regards,
Edgar

As luck has it, I gave a talk in Mark's group last Thursday. They also
gave me a quite thorough introduction into their OPT setup. With a little
bit of hardware design, we should be able to make a custom "OpenOPT", i.e.
adapting OpenSPIM for OPT imaging. The biggest problem is that we'd need
at least 400 rotation steps, better something like 1200 (or a very fast
camera and a continuous, low-speed rotation). I am not quite sure how we
could get that, probably we'd need to contact Picard systems.

The good news is that almost all the software required to reconstruct the
3D images from the projections is Open Source, i.e. it is accessible and
adaptable.

Ciao,
Dscho

Hi Edgar and everyone,

With regards to the DLL problems that recent updates have generated:
- It seems I accidentally built PicardStage in debug mode (hence the 'D' on the end of the DLL names it became dependent on) -- I've since fixed that issue, uploaded the correct version of the DLL, and taken steps to ensure it won't happen again.
- The troubles with TIScam (and some other device adapters) was an artifact of our Visual Studio upgrade: the device adapters became dependent on the '100' (VS2010) versions of the files. Since Micro-Manager does not yet come bundled with the VS2010 runtime environment, most users will be missing those files. I've fixed these issues and uploaded correct versions to the update site as well.
If you are having trouble with device adapters not loading, please try updating through Fiji again and let me know if the problems persist.

I strongly recommend against downloading and installing DLLs from the internet unless they are from the authoritative source (in the case of these 'MSVC' files, Microsoft) -- I would suggest instead downloading the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package -- http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555 for 32-bit computers -- which contains the necessary files.


Sorry about all the trouble! If there are any more problems, please e-mail Johannes, myself, and/or the list.


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

	light sheet thickness
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8Yb=UOBdEFUB+b+HAoE2UzHVa9BfHhs3CYTnyFAd1BHfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Thanks for this latest update: it has almost fixed my PVCAM problem.  Now I
can load the camera, and since the last update I no longer get a time-out
error message when I use the live view.  But, the live window opens and
displays an image, then it doesn't refresh, so I see the same image until I
stop and start live view again.  I can now run the Open SPIM plugin, but
have to keep stopping and starting live view in order to see what is going
on with my calibration sample.  I'm so close!  Any suggestions for fixing
this?  Live view through my camera works fine in a plain, non-Fiji and
non-OpenSPIM installation of Micromanager, so I can align and take pictures
at the moment, but I want to use your lovely plugin.

And another thing... I remember some discussion from earlier this summer
about optimizing the optics.  I have made a light sheet that's about 10
microns thick, minimizing its thickness by adjusting the second telescope
lens as described on the website.  Can I get it thinner than that?  What
should I move to do so?

Thanks again,

Aurelia

If I remember correctly, this was a bug in upstream uManager that has been
fixed in the meantime. It will take a little while to synchronize our
patches with the upstream source code, but after that, the problem should
be gone!

Yes, I seem to remember other reports of this trouble (also with PVCAM, 
if I recall correctly), though I had thought them resolved... I believe 
Johannes is correct, and synchronizing with Micro-Manager may resolve 
this issue. I've started work on this, but the process is 
(frustratingly) intricate, and might take some time. In the future I 
hope to make the process unnecessary.

As a temporary measure, you should have no trouble using the PVCAM 
device adapter from the Micro-Manager nightly build (The file should be 
wherever you installed the 'vanilla' Micro-Manager to; simply copy it to 
OpenSPIM's "mm/win32" directory -- it may ask you to overwrite). If you 
decide to try this, please let me know how it works out.

Thanks,
Luke

 Dear Luke,

I have an issue when clicking the button "Stack at this Z plus", it simply doesn't work.
I have noticed when I press the button and then release it, the button
remains pressed and of course there is no row added to the Position List.

I tried with the option "Insert Current Position" and it works. 

As I can remember I never had this issue using the no-updated version of Fiji.

I don't know if anyone is having the same problem?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Perfect, the 26 September nightly build version of the PVCAM adapter has
cleared up my live view problem!  Thanks very much, I am so happy!

This looks like a dead lock to me. Could you please install a JDK 6, call
the included JVisualVM, attach to the Fiji (or ImageJ) proess and look at
the thread dump whether it says something along the lines "dead lock
detected between thread 2 and 17)?

If you find that information, posting this thread dump as a reply-to-all
of this mail would be incredibly helpful...

Thanks,
Johannes

Hi Edgar,

It sounds as though an exception is being generated and then (very quietly) ignored -- it may show up in a core log, though; could you see about attaching it?

Thanks,

Hi Johannes & Luke,

Sorry for the late reply, it was a little bit hard to understand the instructions about
finding the "dead lock" since I am not a programming guy :-/. It is the first time
I do that.

I already look through the lines of the threaddump and I didn't find anything like
"dead lock detected between thread 2 and 17" so, is there something else
I could do in order to find a solution to this?

I will continue on monday, have a nice weekend and thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Have you taken the thread dump after pressing that button that gets stuck?
How about posting the thread dump here?

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody has any CAD files (or any other 3D files for 
that matter: Maya, 3DS Max, Blender etc.) of the complete setup.  It 
would be great to get a feel for what's happening on the breadboard 
during my planning stages.

Thanks in advance for your time.

 Hi Johannes,

Now I have taken the threaddump after pressing the button that gets stuck
and I didn't find anything about a dead lock.

Anyway I post the threaddump here, maybe you can find something since I
really don't what every line means.

Have you taken the thread dump after pressing that button that gets stuck?
How about posting the thread dump here?

Hello Neil,

I can send you the CAD file(s) for the complete setup, but I need to know
which file format you would prefer... (I use SolidWorks)

Why not upload the files as Open Source, in a standard format such as
Wavefront .obj? If the Wiki refuses, please let me know, I *am* able to
fix some problems ;-)
