<PRE>Zheng,

Go with the Titan Black.  In terms of hardware, it is nearly the same thing as a K6000.  As has been mentioned, the K4000 is significantly less graphics card than the Titan and really only effective in a pair with a Tesla card for compute performance.  We are using K5200s mostly for support in our 840 HP towers, the price point and the possible upgrade path to a K5200 and Tesla combo.  All of these cards should be supported in the new dll I referenced earlier.

Cheers,

Seth

Hi,Seth and Doug,‍
    I searched the prices of the cards of Titan and Quadro, and found that the GeForce GTX Titan Black($1293) is more expensive than the Quadro K4000($977). Which kinds of Quadro does you use now, Seth?
   And just a few monthes ago, nVidia released the newest card of Titan X, but it does not acquire right now. And I also worry about the compatibility between sofeware and this newest kind of hardware.
    Can you send me the hardware configuration of your computer, Seth and Doug‍?
    Thank for replying me! All best!

Yes, we’re very happy with our GeForce GTX Titan Black.  We purchased it for ~$1000 through Newegg.com

Zheng,

Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia had they’re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html</A>).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn’t worth the extra cost either.

Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (<A HREF="http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html">http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html</A>).

Once you’ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github (<A HREF="https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases">https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases</A>).

Happy crunching!

Seth

Hi,everyone:
    Now I want to buy a computer to do the OpenSpim. Howeve, I don't know what kinds of graphics cards should I buy, Tesla or Quadro? I know Telsa is specific used for culculate and it is not support display, and quadro can be used for culculate and display.
Does the software of OpenSpim/fiji emphasize parallel culculate or render(display) ?
    Besides, I have no enough menoy to buy a computer equiped with both kinds of cards.
‍‍
    Thanks !
    All best!
