<PRE>Zheng,

Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia had they&#8217;re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html</A>).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn&#8217;t worth the extra cost either.

Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (<A HREF="http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html">http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html</A>).

Once you&#8217;ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github (<A HREF="https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases">https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases</A>).

Happy crunching!

Seth

Hi,everyone:
    Now I want to buy a computer to do the OpenSpim. Howeve, I don't know what kinds of graphics cards should I buy, Tesla or Quadro? I know Telsa is specific used for culculate and it is not support display, and quadro can be used for culculate and display.
Does the software of OpenSpim/fiji emphasize parallel culculate or render(display) ?
    Besides, I have no enough menoy to buy a computer equiped with both kinds of cards.
&#8205;&#8205;
    Thanks !
    All best!
    &#8205;
