<PRE>Hi,Seth and Doug,‍
    I searched the prices of the cards of Titan and Quadro, and found that the GeForce GTX Titan Black($1293) is more expensive than the Quadro K4000($977). Which kinds of Quadro does you use now, Seth?
   And just a few monthes ago, nVidia released the newest card of Titan X, but it does not acquire right now. And I also worry about the compatibility between sofeware and this newest kind of hardware.
    Can you send me the hardware configuration of your computer, Seth and Doug‍?
    Thank for replying me! All best!

Yes, we’re very happy with our GeForce GTX Titan Black.  We purchased it for ~$1000 through Newegg.com

Zheng,
 
 
 
Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia  had they’re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html</A>).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push  users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory  architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn’t worth the extra cost either. 
 
 
 
Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (<A HREF="http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html">http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html</A>).
 
 
 
Once you’ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github  (<A HREF="https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases">https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases</A>).
 
 
 
Happy crunching!
 
 
 
Seth

Hi,everyone:
 
  
    Now I want to buy a computer to do the OpenSpim. Howeve, I don't know what kinds of graphics cards should I buy, Tesla or Quadro? I know Telsa is specific used for culculate and it is not support display, and quadro can be used for  culculate and display.
 
  
Does the software of OpenSpim/fiji emphasize parallel culculate or render(display) ?
 
  
    Besides, I have no enough menoy to buy a computer equiped with both kinds of cards.
 
  
‍‍
 
  
    Thanks !
 
  
    All best!
