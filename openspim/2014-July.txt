Hi again,

Thanks! I've replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar. I can now configure all 3
components, although I still get the COM3 error messages.  The shutter and
camera then seem to function, but I can't start the SPIM plugin to see if
the stage is working.  I don't get an error message that says my setup is
invalid, the plugin just fails to start.  I attach the configuration file
that I have just made, and a corelog showing an attempt to start the
plugin.  My system info is:

Is that the system information you need?

Hi Aurelia,

> Thanks! I&#39;ve replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar. I can now configure all 3 components, although I still get the COM3 error messages. The shutter and camera then seem to function, but I can&#39;t start the SPIM plugin to see if the stage is working. I don&#39;t get an error message that says my setup is invalid, the plugin just fails to start. I attach the configuration file that I have just made, and a corelog showing an attempt to start the plugin.

The COM3 error message is happening because of the duplicate line in the configuration file -- though, if the configurator is generating this file each time, there is probably an underlying issue that requires investigation. (Unfortunately, it isn't obvious to me why this might happen; finding this out could take time.) A quick fix would be to edit the config file in a text editor and remove line 7 or 8 ("Device,COM3,SerialManager,COM3").


The SPIM plugin won't start because the stage configuration is confusing it. Two possibilities: Either the COM3 error is leaving the stages only partially initialized, so the stage position is invalid (out of the stage's range, according to its properties), or a stage (usually the twister) was left in a position outside its accepted range. Given the PVCAM exception earlier in the CoreLog, I would assume the former -- but to be sure, before starting the system, please try using the Picard software to home the three linear stages and zero the rotational stage, leaving them all inside the usual position range.

Yes, thank you! It doesn't reveal much about the problem, but at the very least it confirms that the system should be working...


Just to keep track of what we've done so far (so I know what to change in the next update):
- Updated mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll and all system DALs to the latest versions.
- Replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar with Micro-Manager's preferred version.


Nearly there, I think!
Luke

Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I&#39;m still not entirely certain what&#39;s going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren&#39;t correct, they probably wouldn&#39;t load at all, so presumably you&#39;ve already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3."

I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

I&#39;ve updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier).

Hi,
I have an even more important question: what's the ideal way to cite
OpenSPIM in our hopefully imminent publication? The homepage address? The
Nature Methods letter? Another publication?
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi again,

Yep, the COM3 messages stop when I get rid of the extra line in the
configuration file. Oh! This is exciting!  After I start up and load the
configuration file without the extra COM3 line, I can start the plugin, and
move the stage! However, when I try to start live view, I then get a
Micro-Manager error: "Error in device Camera-1: The device cannot set this
property at the moment."  Trying to use Snap gives "Error Acquiring: null."
Well, it was exciting for me anyhow. Another corelog is attached.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <7590c10c210ad.53b2b3ad@wiscmail.wisc.edu>

There certainly seems to be something odd about the camera adapter right now. Specifically,

2014-07-01T18:07:18.997408 tid6872 [IFO,dev:Camera-1] PVCAM API error: "C0_CAM_NAME_NOT_FOUND This is not a valid name for opening the camera", code: 14

Do you get this error opening only the live view, without starting the SPIM Acquisition plugin? The core log seems to suggest that the camera works fine until the plugin is launched. Most likely, when the plugin defines an automatic pixel size, some sort of reset occurs in the core, but the camera adapter doesn't tolerate it well (I feel like I've encountered this issue before with a different camera adapter... I'll have to look into this; it might be a report for the MM team to look at.). As a short-term workaround, you can define a pixel size before launching the software, using Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration. (If a pixel size is predefined, the SPIM plugin won't try to add one.) After defining a pixel size, save the configuration (Tools -> Save Configuration Settings As...) so you won't need to re-make the pixel size definition each time.


Please try that workaround and let me know if you still have issues; I'll add the immediate fixes on the update sites and see what I can do about tracking down this bug.


Thanks!
Luke

After I start up and load the configuration file without the extra COM3 line, I can start the plugin, and move the stage! However, when I try to start live view, I then get a Micro-Manager error: "Error in device Camera-1: The device cannot set this property at the moment." Trying to use Snap gives "Error Acquiring: null."

(Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t obvious to me why this might happen; finding this out could take time.) A quick fix would be to edit the config file in a text editor and remove line 7 or 8 ("Device,COM3,SerialManager,COM3").

Two possibilities: Either the COM3 error is leaving the stages only partially initialized, so the stage position is invalid (out of the stage&#39;s range, according to its properties), or a stage (usually the twister) was left in a position outside its accepted range. Given the PVCAM exception earlier in the CoreLog, I would assume the former -- but to be sure, before starting the system, please try using the Picard software to home the three linear stages and zero the rotational stage, leaving them all inside the usual position range.

Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I&#39;m still not entirely certain what&#39;s going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren&#39;t correct, they probably wouldn&#39;t load at all, so presumably you&#39;ve already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3."

I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

I&#39;ve updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

Hi again,

Yes, setting the pixel size lets the camera work again!   I also had to
switch the Picard serial numbers in the configuration file to their actual
values, as I had switched them around initially to get the focus stage to
be the correct one.  The plugin is now functional.  I can create a
configuration file, start the SPIM plugin, then save it to get a pixel
size.  I still need to remove the extra COM3 line from the configuration
file manually, and when I start live view there is a MicroManager error:
Error:
org.micromanager.MMStudioMainFrame.updateCenterAndDragListener(MMStudioMainFrame.java.2240)

but when I dismiss it, everything seems to function normally.  I am still
getting sporadic Acquiring: null errors when I start acquisition, but that
predated this change.  Let me know if I should send any more info.
Thanks very much Luke!

Aurelia

Hi everyone,
Today, while looking at my calibration grid, I find that the x, y,and z
stages behave normally, but that the rotation stage is acting odd.  I can't
rotate only one step; the stage doesn't move unless I click two steps.
Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the
angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24,
then 6.48, etc.  The information in the configuration file seems to be
correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.

Hi Aurelia,

Glancing at your old configuration file, the twister step size seems to be set to 1.8 -- however, a change to the Picard USB library has altered the correct value for the step size; now, rather than motor steps, the usual set-position command operates in degrees; that is, the correct step size is 1.0. Try changing your configuration to use this value instead and see if that helps.

I can&#39;t rotate only one step; the stage doesn&#39;t move unless I click two steps. Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24, then 6.48, etc. The information in the configuration file seems to be correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.

Hi Mark & Luke,

I'm writing to ask whether there is a solution for running the openSPIM
software in the 64bit system? (The uManager studio can't be loaded normally
in my 64 bit system) Can I get access to the source code for modification?

Run it in compatibility mode.

To do this, do the following.

Right click imagej/fiji.
Select properties.
Go to the Compatibility tab.
Check the "run this program in compatibility mode for:" box.
Select Windows XP (Service Pack 3).
Click Apply.
Click OK.

Then try and run it.

When I can work out how to include plugins during compilation I will try to
compile.a win64 version. At such q time i'd happily provide binaries. Im
only a part time python progammer though and therefore have little
experience with debugging compilation issues. Since Compatibility Mode
'just works' for us, it isn't a high priority for me.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

I followed your suggestion. While the problem still existed. When I tried
to launch the uManager studio from the ImageJ(ImageJ-win32.exe) in the
OpenSPIM.app folder, an error: *Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native
library* (*Can't load IA 32-bit.dll on a AMD 64-bit platform*) showed every
time. I did the troubleshooting and the result showed that it's a
incompatible application.

Is there any other way to solve this problem?

Thanks,
Ke

This is strange. I'm not sure what OpenSPIM fiji build we are running but
it works here.

Have you tried going back to a base installation?

It sounds odd that uManager can even detect your pc as a "amd64" system as
compatibility mode should mask that as 32bit.

What says "its an incompatible application"?

Of course, mm *should* be able to load a 32bit dll on 64bit architecture. I
don't understand why that should be a problem for mm in the first place.
The whole x86 instruction set is encapsulated within the x64 set. To
Johannes/Mark is this directly related to the available jre?

For base installation, you mean install the OpenSPIM/Fiji package here:
http://openspim.org/Downloads again?

I followed the troubleshooting instructions in the compatibility tab and
the result is "its an incompatible application".

I did the following steps to open the uManager studio:

   1. Download the Fiji package of the continuous release version for
Windows 7(64bit) from  : http://fiji.sc/Fiji

   2. Download the OpenSPIM package (*OpenSPIM-20140207.zip*) from :
http://openspim.org/Downloads

   3. Launch Fiji: in the Fiji.app/folder, open *ImageJ-win64.exe*

   4. Update Fiji (and OpenSPIM and uManager):* Help->Update Fiji *

   5. Run Micromanager Studio: In the *OpenSPIM.app* folder, open
*ImageJ-win32.exe*, then *plugins->Micro-manager->Micro-manager studio*
(Before this step, I have followed your steps and set the compatibility
mode of the *ImageJ-win32.exe* as Windows XP (Service Pack 3))

After Step 5, an error shows as follows:
*    Error:Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V*

To solve this error, I copied the file *MMCoreJ_wrap.dll* in the *mm*
folder of the *OpenSPIM.app* folder into the same directory of the
*ImageJ-win32.exe.
*Then when I reloaded the uManager studio from the ImageJ (32bit), the
error was as follows:
   *Error:Failed to load the MMcoreJ_wrap native library *
*
 C:\Users\Kuolab\Downloads\SPIM\OpenSPIM-20140207\OpenSPIM.app\MMCoreJ_wrap.dll:
Can't load IA 32-bit. dll on a AMD 64-bit platform. *

    I tried to open the uManager studio from *ImageJ-win32.exe and*
*ImageJ-win64.exe*, while the second error above happened all the time in
the two cases.

   The camera driver has been installed correctly before based on the test
image results.

Is there any step I misconducted? (Maybe copying the *MMCoreJ_warp.dll*
into the same directory of the *ImageJ-win32.exe* is not correct?)

This is not what I did. Just use the openspim.org distribution. It comes
with *everything pre installed*. Dont do anything else, you shouldn't need
to download the fiji installer. Just open the OpenSpim distribution in
compatibility mode. Micromanager will be in the plugins waiting for you.

Fwiw I haven't updated either. But if you download from the openspim.org
website it should be relatively fresh and up to date.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Christian,

Sorry for the delay! Windows 7 32-bit shouldn't have much trouble running the OpenSPIM software; we've had several people now run the system on 32-bit Windows 7 with no problems. Is there a particular error you get while running the program on Windows 7? (64-bit OpenSPIM is still being worked on, though some users have suggested that the 32-bit version can run in 64-bit Windows using compatibility mode.)


For changing the axes around, it should work to put in different serial numbers during set-up. When adding the Picard X/Y Stage device, put in to the Serial Number (X) field the number after 'SN' on the X stage sticker. For Serial Number (Y), use the number from the Z stage. Then, when adding the Picard Z Stage device, put in the number from the Y stage. (This is an unusual set-up; if you don't mind my asking, for what kind of experiments are you using the OpenSPIM system? I'm always interested in the unique ways people apply the hardware and software!)


Hope this helps!
Luke

Hi Kieran and Ke,

I just tested a fresh, completely up-to-date installation of OpenSPIM (*only* OpenSPIM-20140207.zip) on a 64-bit computer. On my machine, the software had the error Ke refers to: "Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library." The problem seems to happen when OpenSPIM uses a 64-bit JRE to load a 32-bit DLL. Please make sure you install a 32-bit JRE from http://www.java.com .


If you already have a 32-bit JRE installed on your computer, either of these additional steps should help:


This solution may change how other Java applications run:
- Click Start -> Right click "My Computer" -> Properties.
- On the left, click "Advanced System Settings".
- Click "Environment Variables...".
- Under System Variables, click "New..."
- In Variable name, enter "JAVA_HOME". In Variable value, put the full path to the 32-bit JRE (for example, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7").


This solution may use some extra hard-drive space, but will only affect OpenSPIM:
- Download and Extract OpenSPIM-20140207.zip. In OpenSPIM.app, make a new folder called "java".
- Copy all files from the Java JRE directory (i.e. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7") into this new folder.


Now OpenSPIM will use the 32-bit JRE to run, which should resolve the problem.


Please let me know if this helps!
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

Whew, sorry about the delay.

As you've probably guessed by now, no, only the twister has changed. The linear stages should be fine as they're set.

Try changing your configuration to use this value instead and see if that helps.

I can&#39;t rotate only one step; the stage doesn&#39;t move unless I click two steps. Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24, then 6.48, etc. The information in the configuration file seems to be correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.

Thanks Luke.

The older version I have "just works" out if the box so I wont update.
Fiji updates often bugger up local stuff like this *sigh*. We use a Jython
script for something else and a recent fiji update did something that now
gives us Jython script errors. Nothing major but still a bit annoying.
Sometimes I wish the updates were better tested before rollout but I guess
that's the price of speedy updates.

Cheers Kieran

The price is actually that you should work with the maintainer to make
sure that your workflow is supported even if we switch to a modern
architecture and try to adapt the old architecture so that formerly
working scripts still work.

I understand that you do not want to update because you have been burnt,
but on the other hand I do not recall any bug report via Help>Report a
Bug, either.

In truth, we are working very hard here, but we do not try to guess about
bugs. We rely on proper bug reports and responsive bug reporters. A little
bit of the burden really lies also with the users.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much! After I install the 32bit JRE, there is no more error and I
can launch the uManager studio and do the acquisition normally.

Kieran, thanks for your patient reply all the same!

Ke

Hi Luke,
No worries!  I was actually hoping you would say yes, because my linear
stages are making a new sound when they do long travel steps... they go to
the right place, but they make an alarming noise, as though they're trying
to go too fast or slow, or something.  Sorry for the barrage of odd
problems, it seems my setup is in revolt somehow.
Aurelia

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8Zr_+r=jbURfPJcuRDiWAV4ki_+SVuPta8F0k9n=QkXjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
First, I wanted to say that after last week's updates, the MicroManager
error I was seeing on starting my camera is gone and configurations are
loading correctly, so thanks for those!  And, I have a question about the
anti-drift function.  Is it supposed to be autonomous at all, or does one
need to be present, correcting the sample position for each timepoint?  I
had assumed that it was supposed to run on its own, but my samples always
end up spiraling out of the field of view. Maybe I have inappropriate
expectations of it?   My pixel size is set correctly, and I don't know what
else would affect it.
Thanks,
Aurelia

In theory, the user shouldn't need to interact with it at all, though sometimes it helps to provide the first few corrections to get the sample in place. I've only seen it wildly overcorrect when the pixel size is missing/defaulted to 1... Could you possibly verify your pixel size setting, using Micro-Manager's 'mouse moves stage' feature? Try to drag a particular structure around in the view, making sure it follows the mouse pointer closely across the entire field of view. (You might need to flip the camera's view using properties in the Property Browser, if the stage is moving in the wrong direction.) I suggest this particular test since, at its basic level, this is precisely what anti-drift does: move particular features around to 'keep' their positions. Please also make sure that the pixel size you set is still in use after starting the OpenSPIM plugin, and that your configuration is saved with the correct pixel size set. (Importantly, also make sure that the property criteria set for your pixel size are being fulfilled by your setup -- usually the only property I specify is "Core-Initialize" must be "1".) One final idea is to try over-setting the pixel size slightly; this should reduce the offset size of the anti-drift somewhat.


Barring this most likely possibility, the problem could also be something physical -- a motor snagging on its track or something like that, distorting the plugin's perception of position or interfering with the stage's ability to adjust its position. Alternatively, depending on the nature of the sample, the phase correlation may be having trouble automatically determining the offset (looking through the diffs directory might help). Another source of information may be the 'log.txt' file in the acquisition directory (though it is only made in the output directory of the first acquisition each time after the software is started); historically the plugin has logged the offsets applied to each view to that file.


And of course, if you're okay with not getting any sleep, you CAN manually intercede at each timepoint. ;-)


I'm sorry I can't immediately be of more help; ruling out pixel size leaves many equally unlikely explanations that are more difficult to verify. If you find the problem, or need more help, please feel free to write the list again; I'll see what I can do. Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,
Right!  I've never actually had the 'mouse moves stage' function working,
but thought it wasn't a big problem and used the stage controls tab
instead.  I have just found the 'Mouse moves stage' item that needs to be
clicked in the Tools menu, which I hadn't seen before, and did have to
transpose X and Y in my camera properties to get it to behave correctly.  I
think the X and Y transposition probably explains the interesting
"spiraling out of the frame" behavior I was seeing!  I'll try a timelapse
now and see if it works better. Thank you!
Aurelia

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Anti-drift update
Message-ID: <CAHAw+8Zy2fTh6pRuEq3NVC=BeyzTPp1nOp+uRC0tFFry4+xoMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm still having trouble with the anti-drift function, and I'm not sure how
to proceed.  To explain the trouble, I made the following test: I set up a
5-time point acquisition with only one view, turned on the anti-drift, and
made a manual correction to first one, then made no more adjustments after
that.  The frames are 100 seconds apart, so no significant actual drift
should be occurring.
If I make a correction to Y or Z, I get the result I expect; the image
moves the right distance, in the right direction, and then doesn't move
again in the last 3 frames. But if I make a correction in X, the stage
moves to the correct position, but then on the following frame moves 2x the
previous distance, and then next time moves 2x the previous one again,
until it leaves the field of view.  The attached image shows z-projections
of subsequent frames, with red being the first one, green the second, and
blue is third frame.  If I correct to the left instead of right, the embryo
continues off to the left instead.  Setting the stage or the camera to
"transpose mirror X" in the tools/property browser changes whether the live
view mouse control behaves correctly, but doesn't alter this behavior.
A sample log file showing the anti-drift corrections:
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {8.6508; 0; 0}  (this x correction is the one I have
put in)
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {16.46055; -0.2493; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {34.48305; 0.2403; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {69.08625; -1.08135; 0}

It seems like there is a sign error of some kind, but I can't figure out a
way to change my configuration to correct it.  I have already switched the
X and Y serial numbers in my configuration file, which improved things a
little (previously this test resulted in the embryo traveling in circles).
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi again,

Thanks! I've replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar. I can now configure all 3
components, although I still get the COM3 error messages.  The shutter and
camera then seem to function, but I can't start the SPIM plugin to see if
the stage is working.  I don't get an error message that says my setup is
invalid, the plugin just fails to start.  I attach the configuration file
that I have just made, and a corelog showing an attempt to start the
plugin.  My system info is:

Is that the system information you need?

Hi Aurelia,

> Thanks! I&#39;ve replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar. I can now configure all 3 components, although I still get the COM3 error messages. The shutter and camera then seem to function, but I can&#39;t start the SPIM plugin to see if the stage is working. I don&#39;t get an error message that says my setup is invalid, the plugin just fails to start. I attach the configuration file that I have just made, and a corelog showing an attempt to start the plugin.

The COM3 error message is happening because of the duplicate line in the configuration file -- though, if the configurator is generating this file each time, there is probably an underlying issue that requires investigation. (Unfortunately, it isn't obvious to me why this might happen; finding this out could take time.) A quick fix would be to edit the config file in a text editor and remove line 7 or 8 ("Device,COM3,SerialManager,COM3").


The SPIM plugin won't start because the stage configuration is confusing it. Two possibilities: Either the COM3 error is leaving the stages only partially initialized, so the stage position is invalid (out of the stage's range, according to its properties), or a stage (usually the twister) was left in a position outside its accepted range. Given the PVCAM exception earlier in the CoreLog, I would assume the former -- but to be sure, before starting the system, please try using the Picard software to home the three linear stages and zero the rotational stage, leaving them all inside the usual position range.

Yes, thank you! It doesn't reveal much about the problem, but at the very least it confirms that the system should be working...


Just to keep track of what we've done so far (so I know what to change in the next update):
- Updated mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll and all system DALs to the latest versions.
- Replaced rsyntaxtextarea.jar with Micro-Manager's preferred version.


Nearly there, I think!

Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I&#39;m still not entirely certain what&#39;s going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren&#39;t correct, they probably wouldn&#39;t load at all, so presumably you&#39;ve already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

I&#39;ve updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier).

Hi,
I have an even more important question: what's the ideal way to cite
OpenSPIM in our hopefully imminent publication? The homepage address? The
Nature Methods letter? Another publication?
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi again,

Yep, the COM3 messages stop when I get rid of the extra line in the
configuration file. Oh! This is exciting!  After I start up and load the
configuration file without the extra COM3 line, I can start the plugin, and
move the stage! However, when I try to start live view, I then get a
Micro-Manager error: "Error in device Camera-1: The device cannot set this
property at the moment."  Trying to use Snap gives "Error Acquiring: null."
Well, it was exciting for me anyhow. Another corelog is attached.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <7590c10c210ad.53b2b3ad@wiscmail.wisc.edu>

There certainly seems to be something odd about the camera adapter right now. Specifically,

2014-07-01T18:07:18.997408 tid6872 [IFO,dev:Camera-1] PVCAM API error: "C0_CAM_NAME_NOT_FOUND This is not a valid name for opening the camera", code: 14

Do you get this error opening only the live view, without starting the SPIM Acquisition plugin? The core log seems to suggest that the camera works fine until the plugin is launched. Most likely, when the plugin defines an automatic pixel size, some sort of reset occurs in the core, but the camera adapter doesn't tolerate it well (I feel like I've encountered this issue before with a different camera adapter... I'll have to look into this; it might be a report for the MM team to look at.). As a short-term workaround, you can define a pixel size before launching the software, using Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration. (If a pixel size is predefined, the SPIM plugin won't try to add one.) After defining a pixel size, save the configuration (Tools -> Save Configuration Settings As...) so you won't need to re-make the pixel size definition each time.


Please try that workaround and let me know if you still have issues; I'll add the immediate fixes on the update sites and see what I can do about tracking down this bug.


Thanks!

After I start up and load the configuration file without the extra COM3 line, I can start the plugin, and move the stage! However, when I try to start live view, I then get a Micro-Manager error: "Error in device Camera-1: The device cannot set this property at the moment." Trying to use Snap gives "Error Acquiring: null."

(Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t obvious to me why this might happen; finding this out could take time.) A quick fix would be to edit the config file in a text editor and remove line 7 or 8 ("Device,COM3,SerialManager,COM3").

Two possibilities: Either the COM3 error is leaving the stages only partially initialized, so the stage position is invalid (out of the stage&#39;s range, according to its properties), or a stage (usually the twister) was left in a position outside its accepted range. Given the PVCAM exception earlier in the CoreLog, I would assume the former -- but to be sure, before starting the system, please try using the Picard software to home the three linear stages and zero the rotational stage, leaving them all inside the usual position range.

Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I&#39;m still not entirely certain what&#39;s going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren&#39;t correct, they probably wouldn&#39;t load at all, so presumably you&#39;ve already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3."

I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

I&#39;ve updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

Hi again,

Yes, setting the pixel size lets the camera work again!   I also had to
switch the Picard serial numbers in the configuration file to their actual
values, as I had switched them around initially to get the focus stage to
be the correct one.  The plugin is now functional.  I can create a
configuration file, start the SPIM plugin, then save it to get a pixel
size.  I still need to remove the extra COM3 line from the configuration
file manually, and when I start live view there is a MicroManager error:
Error:
org.micromanager.MMStudioMainFrame.updateCenterAndDragListener(MMStudioMainFrame.java.2240)

but when I dismiss it, everything seems to function normally.  I am still
getting sporadic Acquiring: null errors when I start acquisition, but that
predated this change.  Let me know if I should send any more info.
Thanks very much Luke!

Aurelia

Hi everyone,
Today, while looking at my calibration grid, I find that the x, y,and z
stages behave normally, but that the rotation stage is acting odd.  I can't
rotate only one step; the stage doesn't move unless I click two steps.
Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the
angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24,
then 6.48, etc.  The information in the configuration file seems to be
correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.
Any ideas?  No error appears in my core log.
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi Aurelia,

Glancing at your old configuration file, the twister step size seems to be set to 1.8 -- however, a change to the Picard USB library has altered the correct value for the step size; now, rather than motor steps, the usual set-position command operates in degrees; that is, the correct step size is 1.0. Try changing your configuration to use this value instead and see if that helps.

I can&#39;t rotate only one step; the stage doesn&#39;t move unless I click two steps. Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24, then 6.48, etc. The information in the configuration file seems to be correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.

Hi Mark & Luke,

I'm writing to ask whether there is a solution for running the openSPIM
software in the 64bit system? (The uManager studio can't be loaded normally
in my 64 bit system) Can I get access to the source code for modification?

Run it in compatibility mode.

To do this, do the following.

Right click imagej/fiji.
Select properties.
Go to the Compatibility tab.
Check the "run this program in compatibility mode for:" box.
Select Windows XP (Service Pack 3).
Click Apply.
Click OK.

Then try and run it.

When I can work out how to include plugins during compilation I will try to
compile.a win64 version. At such q time i'd happily provide binaries. Im
only a part time python progammer though and therefore have little
experience with debugging compilation issues. Since Compatibility Mode
'just works' for us, it isn't a high priority for me.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

I followed your suggestion. While the problem still existed. When I tried
to launch the uManager studio from the ImageJ(ImageJ-win32.exe) in the
OpenSPIM.app folder, an error: *Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native
library* (*Can't load IA 32-bit.dll on a AMD 64-bit platform*) showed every
time. I did the troubleshooting and the result showed that it's a
incompatible application.

Is there any other way to solve this problem?

Thanks,
Ke

This is strange. I'm not sure what OpenSPIM fiji build we are running but
it works here.

Have you tried going back to a base installation?

It sounds odd that uManager can even detect your pc as a "amd64" system as
compatibility mode should mask that as 32bit.

What says "its an incompatible application"?

Of course, mm *should* be able to load a 32bit dll on 64bit architecture. I
don't understand why that should be a problem for mm in the first place.
The whole x86 instruction set is encapsulated within the x64 set. To
Johannes/Mark is this directly related to the available jre?

For base installation, you mean install the OpenSPIM/Fiji package here:
http://openspim.org/Downloads again?

I followed the troubleshooting instructions in the compatibility tab and
the result is "its an incompatible application".

I did the following steps to open the uManager studio:

   1. Download the Fiji package of the continuous release version for
Windows 7(64bit) from  : http://fiji.sc/Fiji

   2. Download the OpenSPIM package (*OpenSPIM-20140207.zip*) from :
http://openspim.org/Downloads

   3. Launch Fiji: in the Fiji.app/folder, open *ImageJ-win64.exe*

   4. Update Fiji (and OpenSPIM and uManager):* Help->Update Fiji *

   5. Run Micromanager Studio: In the *OpenSPIM.app* folder, open
*ImageJ-win32.exe*, then *plugins->Micro-manager->Micro-manager studio*
(Before this step, I have followed your steps and set the compatibility
mode of the *ImageJ-win32.exe* as Windows XP (Service Pack 3))

After Step 5, an error shows as follows:
*    Error:Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V*

To solve this error, I copied the file *MMCoreJ_wrap.dll* in the *mm*
folder of the *OpenSPIM.app* folder into the same directory of the
*ImageJ-win32.exe.
*Then when I reloaded the uManager studio from the ImageJ (32bit), the
error was as follows:
   *Error:Failed to load the MMcoreJ_wrap native library *
*
 C:\Users\Kuolab\Downloads\SPIM\OpenSPIM-20140207\OpenSPIM.app\MMCoreJ_wrap.dll:
Can't load IA 32-bit. dll on a AMD 64-bit platform. *

    I tried to open the uManager studio from *ImageJ-win32.exe and*
*ImageJ-win64.exe*, while the second error above happened all the time in
the two cases.

   The camera driver has been installed correctly before based on the test
image results.

Is there any step I misconducted? (Maybe copying the *MMCoreJ_warp.dll*
into the same directory of the *ImageJ-win32.exe* is not correct?)

This is not what I did. Just use the openspim.org distribution. It comes
with *everything pre installed*. Dont do anything else, you shouldn't need
to download the fiji installer. Just open the OpenSpim distribution in
compatibility mode. Micromanager will be in the plugins waiting for you.

Fwiw I haven't updated either. But if you download from the openspim.org
website it should be relatively fresh and up to date.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Christian,

Sorry for the delay! Windows 7 32-bit shouldn't have much trouble running the OpenSPIM software; we've had several people now run the system on 32-bit Windows 7 with no problems. Is there a particular error you get while running the program on Windows 7? (64-bit OpenSPIM is still being worked on, though some users have suggested that the 32-bit version can run in 64-bit Windows using compatibility mode.)


For changing the axes around, it should work to put in different serial numbers during set-up. When adding the Picard X/Y Stage device, put in to the Serial Number (X) field the number after 'SN' on the X stage sticker. For Serial Number (Y), use the number from the Z stage. Then, when adding the Picard Z Stage device, put in the number from the Y stage. (This is an unusual set-up; if you don't mind my asking, for what kind of experiments are you using the OpenSPIM system? I'm always interested in the unique ways people apply the hardware and software!)


Hope this helps!
Luke

Hi Kieran and Ke,

I just tested a fresh, completely up-to-date installation of OpenSPIM (*only* OpenSPIM-20140207.zip) on a 64-bit computer. On my machine, the software had the error Ke refers to: "Failed to load the MMCoreJ_wrap native library." The problem seems to happen when OpenSPIM uses a 64-bit JRE to load a 32-bit DLL. Please make sure you install a 32-bit JRE from http://www.java.com .


If you already have a 32-bit JRE installed on your computer, either of these additional steps should help:


This solution may change how other Java applications run:
- Click Start -> Right click "My Computer" -> Properties.
- On the left, click "Advanced System Settings".
- Click "Environment Variables...".
- Under System Variables, click "New..."
- In Variable name, enter "JAVA_HOME". In Variable value, put the full path to the 32-bit JRE (for example, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7").


This solution may use some extra hard-drive space, but will only affect OpenSPIM:
- Download and Extract OpenSPIM-20140207.zip. In OpenSPIM.app, make a new folder called "java".
- Copy all files from the Java JRE directory (i.e. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7") into this new folder.


Now OpenSPIM will use the 32-bit JRE to run, which should resolve the problem.


Please let me know if this helps!
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

Whew, sorry about the delay.

As you've probably guessed by now, no, only the twister has changed. The linear stages should be fine as they're set.

Try changing your configuration to use this value instead and see if that helps.

I can&#39;t rotate only one step; the stage doesn&#39;t move unless I click two steps. Also, the numbers that show up in the angle readout box are surprising; the angle changes in steps of 3.24 instead of 1.8, so it goes from 0 to 3.24, then 6.48, etc. The information in the configuration file seems to be correct, and the stage reacts normally to the Picard controller.

Thanks Luke.

The older version I have "just works" out if the box so I wont update.
Fiji updates often bugger up local stuff like this *sigh*. We use a Jython
script for something else and a recent fiji update did something that now
gives us Jython script errors. Nothing major but still a bit annoying.
Sometimes I wish the updates were better tested before rollout but I guess
that's the price of speedy updates.

Cheers Kieran

The price is actually that you should work with the maintainer to make
sure that your workflow is supported even if we switch to a modern
architecture and try to adapt the old architecture so that formerly
working scripts still work.

I understand that you do not want to update because you have been burnt,
but on the other hand I do not recall any bug report via Help>Report a
Bug, either.

In truth, we are working very hard here, but we do not try to guess about
bugs. We rely on proper bug reports and responsive bug reporters. A little
bit of the burden really lies also with the users.

Ciao,

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much! After I install the 32bit JRE, there is no more error and I
can launch the uManager studio and do the acquisition normally.

Kieran, thanks for your patient reply all the same!

Best,
Ke

Hi Luke,
No worries!  I was actually hoping you would say yes, because my linear
stages are making a new sound when they do long travel steps... they go to
the right place, but they make an alarming noise, as though they're trying
to go too fast or slow, or something.  Sorry for the barrage of odd
problems, it seems my setup is in revolt somehow.
Aurelia

Hello,
First, I wanted to say that after last week's updates, the MicroManager
error I was seeing on starting my camera is gone and configurations are
loading correctly, so thanks for those!  And, I have a question about the
anti-drift function.  Is it supposed to be autonomous at all, or does one
need to be present, correcting the sample position for each timepoint?  I
had assumed that it was supposed to run on its own, but my samples always
end up spiraling out of the field of view. Maybe I have inappropriate
expectations of it?   My pixel size is set correctly, and I don't know what
else would affect it.
Thanks,
Aurelia

In theory, the user shouldn't need to interact with it at all, though sometimes it helps to provide the first few corrections to get the sample in place. I've only seen it wildly overcorrect when the pixel size is missing/defaulted to 1... Could you possibly verify your pixel size setting, using Micro-Manager's 'mouse moves stage' feature? Try to drag a particular structure around in the view, making sure it follows the mouse pointer closely across the entire field of view. (You might need to flip the camera's view using properties in the Property Browser, if the stage is moving in the wrong direction.) I suggest this particular test since, at its basic level, this is precisely what anti-drift does: move particular features around to 'keep' their positions. Please also make sure that the pixel size you set is still in use after starting the OpenSPIM plugin, and that your configuration is saved with the correct pixel size set. (Importantly, also make sure that the property criteria set for your pixel size are being fulfilled by your setup -- usually the only property I specify is "Core-Initialize" must be "1".) One final idea is to try over-setting the pixel size slightly; this should reduce the offset size of the anti-drift somewhat.


Barring this most likely possibility, the problem could also be something physical -- a motor snagging on its track or something like that, distorting the plugin's perception of position or interfering with the stage's ability to adjust its position. Alternatively, depending on the nature of the sample, the phase correlation may be having trouble automatically determining the offset (looking through the diffs directory might help). Another source of information may be the 'log.txt' file in the acquisition directory (though it is only made in the output directory of the first acquisition each time after the software is started); historically the plugin has logged the offsets applied to each view to that file.


And of course, if you're okay with not getting any sleep, you CAN manually intercede at each timepoint. ;-)


I'm sorry I can't immediately be of more help; ruling out pixel size leaves many equally unlikely explanations that are more difficult to verify. If you find the problem, or need more help, please feel free to write the list again; I'll see what I can do. Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,
Right!  I've never actually had the 'mouse moves stage' function working,
but thought it wasn't a big problem and used the stage controls tab
instead.  I have just found the 'Mouse moves stage' item that needs to be
clicked in the Tools menu, which I hadn't seen before, and did have to
transpose X and Y in my camera properties to get it to behave correctly.  I
think the X and Y transposition probably explains the interesting
"spiraling out of the frame" behavior I was seeing!  I'll try a timelapse
now and see if it works better. Thank you!
Aurelia

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8Zy2fTh6pRuEq3NVC=BeyzTPp1nOp+uRC0tFFry4+xoMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm still having trouble with the anti-drift function, and I'm not sure how
to proceed.  To explain the trouble, I made the following test: I set up a
5-time point acquisition with only one view, turned on the anti-drift, and
made a manual correction to first one, then made no more adjustments after
that.  The frames are 100 seconds apart, so no significant actual drift
should be occurring.
If I make a correction to Y or Z, I get the result I expect; the image
moves the right distance, in the right direction, and then doesn't move
again in the last 3 frames. But if I make a correction in X, the stage
moves to the correct position, but then on the following frame moves 2x the
previous distance, and then next time moves 2x the previous one again,
until it leaves the field of view.  The attached image shows z-projections
of subsequent frames, with red being the first one, green the second, and
blue is third frame.  If I correct to the left instead of right, the embryo
continues off to the left instead.  Setting the stage or the camera to
"transpose mirror X" in the tools/property browser changes whether the live
view mouse control behaves correctly, but doesn't alter this behavior.
A sample log file showing the anti-drift corrections:
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {8.6508; 0; 0}  (this x correction is the one I have
put in)
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {16.46055; -0.2493; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {34.48305; 0.2403; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {69.08625; -1.08135; 0}

It seems like there is a sign error of some kind, but I can't figure out a
way to change my configuration to correct it.  I have already switched the
X and Y serial numbers in my configuration file, which improved things a
little (previously this test resulted in the embryo traveling in circles).
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Aurelia
