<PRE>Dear Team.

I wanted to update my version of the OpenSPIM software and found that the update site link <A HREF="http://openspim.org/update/">http://openspim.org/update/</A> appears to be broken. None of the downloads are working either - or the link from the website to the downloads is broken. The updater in my copy of Fiji isn't working either.

Is there somewhere else I can look for either a download (which would be have been updated on 27/4/15 or sooner) or an update?  I wondered if the link had moved. We're trying to get a multiline Versalase working in the SPIM software. Its seems happy in the most recent build of Micromanager. However this was after we asked the guy who wrote the driver for a little code tweak. However we updated the 'OpenSPIM' installation of Micromanager and now the OpenSPIM software won't play. I had thought of starting again with a fresh install when I found the broken link.

Any pointers to where the software is would be most welcome. Am sure this is temporary glitch or maybe a firewall issue but that seems unlikely.

Thanks

Ann
