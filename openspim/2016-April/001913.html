<PRE>Dear Tim,

I think you are mixing up two issue.

1. Getting rid of stripes.

Yes, you can do a little bit in post-processing but the stripes can be quite complex and are not necessarily straight. Oftentimes you see a lot of lensing and I do not think you can easily remove it with image processing.

a) Double-sided illumination helps. Depending on the sample you may want to do simultaneous or sequential double-sided illumination. There are various ways of merging the two images.
b) A resonant mSPIM mirror is cheap and easy to integrate. You will get rid of most stripes, but again this depends on the sample. The details for a) and b) are in our Opt. Lett. paper (Huisken &amp; Stainier, 2007). Basically, you are pivoting the light sheet around the center of your field of view, e.g. with 1kHz. The stripes are “washed out” during the exposure time of your camera. We use this on most of our systems and it helps a lot to reduce stripes.
c) Multi-view fusion can also help to some extent.

2. DSLM vs. SPIM

Yes, DSLM should also help reducing stripes but I have no experience with that. Basically, your light sheet is not coherent anymore and the sheet does not “interfere with itself”. However, the setup is more expensive and requires you to power and control another element: the galvo scanner to sweep the beam up and down. You need a proper scan mirror and not just the cheap mSPIM mirror. The additional benefit is that the resulting light sheet is more uniform than the cropped Gaussian light sheet. However, you need to illuminate each line with higher intensity which may result in saturation and worse dynamic range. Obviously you need to wait for the scan and need to synchronize your readout. Depending whether you have a global shutter or rolling shutter camera you need to take some precaution.

Best
Jan
