<PRE>Hello all, 

I found the Selzer group's solution (Keller et al. 2013) quite interesting
and would love to know if anyone had a positive experience doing that.
The banding from my basic openSPIM is definitely a problem for
segmentation and analysis.

As far as I can tell fixing the banding will mostly involve buying a scan
mirror.  I don't have a quote yet for the Cambridge VM500 scanning mirror
that the Selzer group used but its ThorLabs equivalent (#GVS101?) costs
about $1k.  That seems reasonable and not that hard for regular folks to
implement.  

In related news I just noticed that the TeraStitcher plugin for Vaa3D now
has an option to fight banding in light sheet data.  I have not tested it
yet but potentially that feature could be useful.  I will just post my
usual warning for folks trying TeraStitcher for the first time: it
stitches really well but it could be a hair more user-friendly.

Best, 


Tim
