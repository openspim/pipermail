Sorry to those of you receiving this multiple times, but I've seen this question on all three lists recently.
For those of you requiring conversion of Zeiss Lightsheet .czi files to .tif for downstream processing, these two ImageJ/Fiji macros may be of use to you:

FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY 2015

G??ttingen, Germany, March 29 - April 1, 2015

28th International Conference on 3D Image Processing in Microscopy
27th International Conference on Confocal Microscopy

Dear Colleagues,

Abstracts for oral and poster presentations can now be submitted
through the conference website: http://www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org where
also the conference registration has opened and hotel information is
available.

Deadline for abstract submission: Wednesday, January 20, 2015

After the successful FOM2014 conference held in Sydney earlier this
year, it is a pleasure to announce FOM2015, the next Focus on
Microscopy conference. It will take place in the Lokhalle venue,
G??ttingen, Germany, in the week before Easter from Sunday 29 March
??? Wednesday 1 April 2015. It will be the next in a series of unique
interdisciplinary meetings on advanced multi-dimensional light
microscopy and image processing.

For further details please visit the FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY website
www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org. There, in addition to general information,
the scientific program of the previous Sydney and other FOM
conferences can be found at the link ???Past conferences???. From 2004
onwards together with links in the scientific program to one page PDF
abstracts of the contributions presented in that year. Please note
also the "Search FOM database " button for full searches over the
digital FOM archive over the years.

FOM2015 is the continuation of a yearly conference series, started in
1988 presenting the latest innovations and newest trends in optical
microscopy, and their application in biology, medicine, and the
material sciences.

Key topics are:

* Theory and practice of confocal and multiphoton-excitation
microscopy
* Super-resolution, nanoscopy imaging: from PSF engineering (4pi,
SIM, STED), fluorescent activation/quenching, stochastic/centroid
(PALM, STORM, GSDIM, SOFI and related techniques) to TIRF
* 3D and 4D live cell and tissue imaging
* Adaptive optics for microscopy
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Light sheet microscopy
* Advanced fluorescence imaging/spectroscopy: FRET, FRAP, FLIM, FCS
* New fluorescence probes, proteins, quantum dots, single molecule
imaging
* Coherent non-linear microscopies: SHG, THG, SFG, CARS.
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Multi-dimensional fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy imaging
* Correlated light/electron microscopy
* Laser manipulation and tracking, photo-activation
* Bio- and nano-materials, biosensors
* OCT, endoscopy
* Fast acquisition, automated and high-content microscopy
* 3D image processing and visualization for multidimensional data

At the 2015 conference the topic ???Super-resolution techniques and
applications??? will receive special attention, this also in
connection with the recently awarded Nobel Prize in this field.

The conference series is in addition known for covering the rapid
development of advanced fluorescence labeling techniques for confocal
and multi-photon 3D imaging of -live- biological specimens.

Abstracts for contributions are invited and can already be submitted
through the website: www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org  where further
information on the present and previous FOM conferences can be found.

Message-ID: <11FEABF97C42FE47AA23C843A13D49EEDDF0C7CC@UWMBX04.uw.lu.se>

Hi,

I have been using the Openspim/Fiji package and managed to install all the drivers in Micro Manager without updating Fiji through help-> update Fiji as mentioned in the description. However, I now realize that I have the same issue as Veli-Pekka described here http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-August/000515.html with the twister not rotating exactly as intended. I have tried adding the mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll from Micro manager 1.4.18 which solved the issue for him, but it is not working with my version of MM (I assume it is because MM is not updated to 1.4.18 or higher, the .dll files from 1.4.17 works fine). Now I'm wondering how to update Micro Manager in the openspim package? I can't seem to find an update site to add and I have tried updating Fiji, openspim and imageJ (and all of them separately) through the ->update Fiji option.

We are running the software in 64-bit windows 7 using compatibility mode for windows xp. The MM .dll files are from the 32-bit versions

Very thankful for help!

[X]Dear all,

we finally managed (why is unclear) to update Fiji, openspim and ImageJ and this time it seems Micro Manager got updated as well, since the new .dll files work.
We also noticed that the issue of rotation is not in the program, but in the transmission in the pulley system of the 4d-stage, i.e. the band is sliding. Not sure how to solve this issue but by looking at the pictures on the website it seems that changing the pulley band is a good idea.

Thanks

Fredrik

Message-ID: <9e8742e99909e74601086e6593b24ba9@ipmc.cnrs.fr>

Dear open spim community members,

We have built an open spim in our MICA facility but have problem of 
reflexions (transmission of the 488nm laser) in the emission path. We 
use a quite good Brightline 525/50 band pass filter from Semrock. This 
transmission of the 488nm is due to the dependance of the wavelength 
transmission of the filter with the angle of incidence. From your 
practical experience, what filter, or combination or filters, could we 
put or add to avoid this problem?
Thanks in advance,
Best regards,
Fr?d?ric

Dear Fr?d?ric,

The parts page says to use a clean up filter for the 488 diode laser, as
it leaks an unmeasurable amount of green light (which happens to be in
the same range as the emission of GFP) I would recommend a 490/20
excitation filter from either Semrock or Chroma to block this unwanted
light.

Pete

Dear Fr?d?ric,
in our open spim setup we had the same issue with the 488 laser like you. We detected laser light in the emission path. The solution - as already mentioned by Pete - is a clean up filter. We found a relative cheap filter from Edmund optics Part No.#65-086. This filter has only a blocking efficiency of 10^-4. However, the filter works fine in our GFP application. This filter fits nicely into the aperture in front of the slit, so there in no need for an additional holder.

Best regards

Hartmann

Dear Michael,
in the bginning I also had the problem of belt slipping. At least I was 
believing that the belt slips. Later I learned that the belt tesion was 
to high and the bearing was hard-steering. This results during the 
operation of the twister stepping motor in a loss of steps. Loss of 
steps or slipping has the same effect, the twister does not turn to the 
expected angle. We solved this issue by exchanging the bearing with a 
smooth running one and by a LONGER belt producing lower tension and 
thereby lower friction in the bearings of the motor and the sample holder.

I don't know if this helps to solve your problem but eventually this 
could help others. At least here in Munich it worked.

Best regards

Hartmann

(most likely for the January issue), and would appreciate your input on
your experiences of building and using the OpenSPIM platform. If you are
willing to share a dataset and/or images of your samples and/or system,

Thank you for your time, understanding, and answers in advance.

Best Regards,

Sorry to those of you receiving this multiple times, but I've seen this question on all three lists recently.
For those of you requiring conversion of Zeiss Lightsheet .czi files to .tif for downstream processing, these two ImageJ/Fiji macros may be of use to you:

FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY 2015

GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, March 29 - April 1, 2015

28th International Conference on 3D Image Processing in Microscopy
27th International Conference on Confocal Microscopy

Dear Colleagues,

Abstracts for oral and poster presentations can now be submitted
through the conference website: http://www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org where
also the conference registration has opened and hotel information is
available.

Deadline for abstract submission: Wednesday, January 20, 2015

After the successful FOM2014 conference held in Sydney earlier this
year, it is a pleasure to announce FOM2015, the next Focus on
Microscopy conference. It will take place in the Lokhalle venue,
GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, in the week before Easter from Sunday 29 March
â Wednesday 1 April 2015. It will be the next in a series of unique
interdisciplinary meetings on advanced multi-dimensional light
microscopy and image processing.

For further details please visit the FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY website
www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org. There, in addition to general information,
the scientific program of the previous Sydney and other FOM
conferences can be found at the link âPast conferencesâ. From 2004
onwards together with links in the scientific program to one page PDF
abstracts of the contributions presented in that year. Please note
also the "Search FOM database " button for full searches over the
digital FOM archive over the years.

FOM2015 is the continuation of a yearly conference series, started in
1988 presenting the latest innovations and newest trends in optical
microscopy, and their application in biology, medicine, and the
material sciences.

Key topics are:

* Theory and practice of confocal and multiphoton-excitation
microscopy
* Super-resolution, nanoscopy imaging: from PSF engineering (4pi,
SIM, STED), fluorescent activation/quenching, stochastic/centroid
(PALM, STORM, GSDIM, SOFI and related techniques) to TIRF
* 3D and 4D live cell and tissue imaging
* Adaptive optics for microscopy
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Light sheet microscopy
* Advanced fluorescence imaging/spectroscopy: FRET, FRAP, FLIM, FCS
* New fluorescence probes, proteins, quantum dots, single molecule
imaging
* Coherent non-linear microscopies: SHG, THG, SFG, CARS.
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Multi-dimensional fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy imaging
* Correlated light/electron microscopy
* Laser manipulation and tracking, photo-activation
* Bio- and nano-materials, biosensors
* OCT, endoscopy
* Fast acquisition, automated and high-content microscopy
* 3D image processing and visualization for multidimensional data

At the 2015 conference the topic âSuper-resolution techniques and
applicationsâ will receive special attention, this also in
connection with the recently awarded Nobel Prize in this field.

The conference series is in addition known for covering the rapid
development of advanced fluorescence labeling techniques for confocal
and multi-photon 3D imaging of -live- biological specimens.

Abstracts for contributions are invited and can already be submitted

Message-ID: <11FEABF97C42FE47AA23C843A13D49EEDDF0C7CC@UWMBX04.uw.lu.se>

Hi,

I have been using the Openspim/Fiji package and managed to install all the drivers in Micro Manager without updating Fiji through help-> update Fiji as mentioned in the description. However, I now realize that I have the same issue as Veli-Pekka described here http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-August/000515.html with the twister not rotating exactly as intended. I have tried adding the mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll from Micro manager 1.4.18 which solved the issue for him, but it is not working with my version of MM (I assume it is because MM is not updated to 1.4.18 or higher, the .dll files from 1.4.17 works fine). Now I'm wondering how to update Micro Manager in the openspim package? I can't seem to find an update site to add and I have tried updating Fiji, openspim and imageJ (and all of them separately) through the ->update Fiji option.

We are running the software in 64-bit windows 7 using compatibility mode for windows xp. The MM .dll files are from the 32-bit versions

Very thankful for help!

[X]Dear all,

we finally managed (why is unclear) to update Fiji, openspim and ImageJ and this time it seems Micro Manager got updated as well, since the new .dll files work.
We also noticed that the issue of rotation is not in the program, but in the transmission in the pulley system of the 4d-stage, i.e. the band is sliding. Not sure how to solve this issue but by looking at the pictures on the website it seems that changing the pulley band is a good idea.

Thanks

Fredrik

Message-ID: <9e8742e99909e74601086e6593b24ba9@ipmc.cnrs.fr>

Dear open spim community members,

We have built an open spim in our MICA facility but have problem of 
reflexions (transmission of the 488nm laser) in the emission path. We 
use a quite good Brightline 525/50 band pass filter from Semrock. This 
transmission of the 488nm is due to the dependance of the wavelength 
transmission of the filter with the angle of incidence. From your 
practical experience, what filter, or combination or filters, could we 
put or add to avoid this problem?
Thanks in advance,
Best regards,
Frédéric

Dear Frédéric,

The parts page says to use a clean up filter for the 488 diode laser, as
it leaks an unmeasurable amount of green light (which happens to be in
the same range as the emission of GFP) I would recommend a 490/20
excitation filter from either Semrock or Chroma to block this unwanted
light.

Pete

Dear Frédéric,
in our open spim setup we had the same issue with the 488 laser like you. We detected laser light in the emission path. The solution - as already mentioned by Pete - is a clean up filter. We found a relative cheap filter from Edmund optics Part No.#65-086. This filter has only a blocking efficiency of 10^-4. However, the filter works fine in our GFP application. This filter fits nicely into the aperture in front of the slit, so there in no need for an additional holder.

Best regards

Hartmann

Dear Michael,
in the bginning I also had the problem of belt slipping. At least I was 
believing that the belt slips. Later I learned that the belt tesion was 
to high and the bearing was hard-steering. This results during the 
operation of the twister stepping motor in a loss of steps. Loss of 
steps or slipping has the same effect, the twister does not turn to the 
expected angle. We solved this issue by exchanging the bearing with a 
smooth running one and by a LONGER belt producing lower tension and 
thereby lower friction in the bearings of the motor and the sample holder.

I don't know if this helps to solve your problem but eventually this 
could help others. At least here in Munich it worked.

Best regards

Hartmann

Dear OpenSPIM Listers,

I am currently writing a broad appeal article for Microscopy and Analysis
(most likely for the January issue), and would appreciate your input on
your experiences of building and using the OpenSPIM platform. If you are
willing to share a dataset and/or images of your samples and/or system,
and give a brief overview of what you research, I might use it in the
final draft (fresh material is better than rehashed wiki images*).

Thank you for your time, understanding, and answers in advance.

Best Regards,

Thank you for the informative reply. I would be much obliged if you would provide me the part information on the replacement bearings and belt.

Dear Michael,
in the bginning I also had the problem of belt slipping. At least I was believing that the belt slips. Later I learned that the belt tesion was to high and the bearing was hard-steering. This results during the operation of the twister stepping motor in a loss of steps. Loss of steps or slipping has the same effect, the twister does not turn to the expected angle. We solved this issue by exchanging the bearing with a smooth running one and by a LONGER belt producing lower tension and thereby lower friction in the bearings of the motor and the sample holder.

I don't know if this helps to solve your problem but eventually this could help others. At least here in Munich it worked.

Best regards

Hartmann

I am struggling with the twister motor belt slipping that others have mentioned.  I have seen the toothed belt used by Edgar's group in Aachen and would be much obliged if he described this in more detail so I could copy it.
