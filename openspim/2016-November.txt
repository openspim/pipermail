Hi every one,
I would like to design my own spim system, the problem is that I do not
have the funds to acquire the laser system, then, to get the money,
previously i should simulate the design to define the optical elements
necessary and the laser and thus apply for state funds.
Here is my question, which design software do you recommend me to simulate
the spim system?

Regards

Hi, Juan,
What kind of system do you want? In many cases, you do not need any
simulation software to figure out desired properties and limitations of
your system. There are a few useful formulas, which describe Gaussian beams
- their thickness, divergence, and numerical aperture properties. See a pdf
attached. Pretty much any light sheet with gaussian intensity profile
should behave closely to these theoretical formulae. Let me know if you
have any questions.
Best,
Nikita

Hi OpenSPIMers,


I am in the process of building an open spim system based on the original open spim. I've tried to image some fluorescent beads but am seeing an odd effect where beads around the edge are being distored with the curvature  of the lens (I have attached an image). We are using a LA1951-A - N-BK7 Plano-Convex Lens as a tube lens rather than the olympus U-TLU. I was wondering if the tube lens is what is causing the abborations but I am fairly new to optics so am not sure. If anyone has any advice on what might be causing the abborations I would lvoe to hear your suggestions as I'm a bit stuck.


Thanks in advance for your advice,


Matt

Hi, Matt,
The image seems to have really strong astigmatism, and the optical axis is
way off center. The lens you use has f=25mm, it is a far cry from what the
tube lens is expected to be, f=180 mm for Olympus objective. You cannot
expect any decent quality from a tube lens which is so far from what the
system design (objective - tube lens). You need a proper tube lens, or at
least an achromat with similar focal distance to have a decent image
quality.
Best,
Nikita

Thanks for your advice. We are using either leica or nikon objectives for detection so I think a f=200mm is needed. I have found two lens on thorlabs which apear to do the job.


https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LBF254-200-A


https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=AC254-200-A-ML


One is an achromat doublet while the other is spherical. Do you have any advice on which would perform better as a tube lens using mutiple lazer lines?


Best wishes,


Matt

I agree with Nikita, but independently from that, if the objective is  
infinity-corrected, it is possible to test a tube lens and its distance  
 from camera by attaching a tube lens to the camera, taking it to a big  
room and trying to get a sharp image of something at the other end of the  
room (I was taking a photo of a reagent bottle trying to get the text on  
the label sharp...)

Monika

Hi, Matt,
If you have to choose between these two lenses, I would definitely go with
the achromat. I would actually recommend 2" diameter lens (f=200 mm),
because the quality of surface is best at the lens center, and 1" lens is
quite small for your purposes.
 Also, at a price of $100 this lens is not a big saving compared to the 200
mm standard tube lens for Nikon objectives (you can buy it from Nikon for
$250 I think).
Best,
Nikita

Hi everyone,

I recently exchanged the computer driving our T-openSPIM. On the new computer, almost everything is working perfectly. Very strangely, I get an error when I want to trigger an image acquisition using MicroManager’s "Multi-Dimensional Acquisition” module: "Error in device "Cobolt": Invalid state (position) requested (12)”.
I have no problem to acquire image otherwise (live mode, SPIMAcquisition plugin). The problem only seems to be with the MM MultiD module.

I attach the Corelog.

I have of course, created a brand new config file and reinstalled the drivers for the laser but that did not solve the issue. I am totally clueless, as this config had been working seamlessly for ages. When migrating to the new computer I took care of zipping Fiji/MM bundle and transfer it "as is” to the new machine.

If anyone has an idea of what could have gone wrong…

Many thanks in advance.

Hi Alexis,


does this only happen with certain imaging configurations, or in general when using Multi-D?
Also, the corelog is not attached to your email (only your GPG signature). Could you resend it please?


cheers!

Sorry for the missing CoreLog… here it is.
It happens in general.

Best,

Alexis

Hi Alexis,


unfortunately, the corelog doesn’t shed too much light onto the problem.
However, you could do the following:


1) Update to a more recent MM version (corelog indicates you’re using 1.4.18, which is a little dated… the problem may have been fixed in the meantime).


2) Try narrowing the problem down to a specific device by creating a config where you replace stage, shutter, cam one-by-one with the respective option from the DemoCamera class and see if that config works.


cheers!
