Subject: [OpenSPIM] Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF
	packages?
Message-ID: <CAD9Sw22PK6vwsS3mvPQg=aYLJV_wCZCHy-mvW1TdPN1Fkk+1cQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have discovered that if I image a Z-stack using Micro-Manager's multi-D
acquisition, the TIFF file generated differs from what I get if I image the
Z-stack using SPIMAcquisition.

Here is what I have discovered so far:

   - MM's Multi-D acquisition uses a micro-manager package,
   namely org.micromanager.acquisition.TaggedImageStorageMultipageTiff, which
   implements the interface org.micromanager.api.TaggedImageStorage
   - OpenSPIM uses packages from OME (Open Microscopy Environment),
   including loci.formats.IFormatWriter,  loci.formats.ImageWriter,
    loci.common.services.ServiceFactory,  loci.formats.MetadataTools,  etc.
   - The two packages write metadata to the TIFF file differently. The main
   difference that is impacting me right now is the metadata for the physical
   space separation between Z slices. Both packages arguably write "CORRECT"
   metadata to the TIFF file, but in different ways. When I read the file  in
   later using ImageJ, or the ImageJ plugin BigDataViewer, the z-spacing info
   is read correctly for the MM Multi-D file. However, when I try to read in a
   file created using SPIMAcquisition, ImageJ always thinks the z-spacing is 1
   cm (when typically it is 3-5 micrometers).
   - The two packages also behave differently for LARGE files. The
   definition of the TIFF file format limits files to no more than 4GB. When
   MM's Multi-D code encounters a file that would be over the 4GB limit, it
   breaks it up into multiple files, each less than 4GB. SPIMAcquisition does
   not do anything different for files over the 4GB limit, which results in an
   error from the OME package. The OME package does support large files via
   switching from TIFF format to BIGTIFF format, but the calling code has to
    specify that. I was able to customize the SPIM code to do this, but the
   resulting BIGTIFF file proved to be unusable in ImageJ.

In both of these cases, the MM Multi-D behavior matches my needs, whereas
the SPIMAcquisition behavior is causing me problems that I have to fix, or
workaround in some way. I have been using the SPIM because we have a SPIM
microscope, and we need support for a stage that can rotate in Theta, as
well as move in X, Y, and Z.

I am posting this first to the SPIM group, although I know this issue
involves interfaces between several groups: SPIM, Micro-manager, OME,
ImageJ, etc.

I would like to ask the SPIM people if there was a reason for using the OME
package for writing TIFF files rather than the MM package?
Because -- I am thinking of customizing my version of the SPIM code to use
the MM package instead.

I appreciate thoughts on the reasonableness of doing this customization to
the TIFF writing code in SPIM.
I also appreciate any other suggestions people have about better ways to
move forward.

I am using the following versions at the moment:
 - Micro-Manager: 1.4.23 20151021
 - ImageJ: 1.50b
 - OpenSPIM: Not sure how to determine this. We originally downloaded the
OpenSPIM/Fiji package. I just checked the OpenSPIM downloads page, and it
is still listing a download dated 4/26/2015, so that must be the one we
used.

Hi Bill,

Is that necessary?  We use Multi-D Acquisition because our SPIM has two lasers, and in my experience the mult-stage position mode handles sample rotation well.  Maybe I am missing something in your plan.

Hi Bill,

I think SPIMAcquistion was intended to be compatible with Fiji seamlessly. That is why it uses OME TIFF package.
Recently, we have updated SPIMAcquisition before Christmas in order to support HDF5 export and fix Anti-Drift.
The update contains the fix for ?over 4GB tiffs? too.
Please, update and give it a try.

For the z-space, you can specify z-space and click ?stack at this Z plus:?.
Each stack contains the z-space based on what you enter.
The pixel calibration is also crucial for having the correct Metadata which will be read by image readers in Fiji.




Thank you for your comments.
Please, let us know if you have any feature request and/or feedback.

Cheers,
HongKee

Hi Tim,

Could I ask you to elaborate on your usage of the multi-stage position in MM Multi-D?  I'm setting up a 2-color SPIM, and wondered how you take your data.

In looking at the Multi-D I see that I can set different 'z' positions of the Twister stage.  I assume you just setup a few positions with different offsets?

Also, I'm confused by the acquisition order...  I'm used to seeing channel then z-position then xy location and then time lapse (for example).  Is the logic reversed in the options in MM?

If it's easier, and you ok with it, maybe you could send a copy of your acquisition settings for me to take a look at?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi Neil,

Our process is pretty simple.  Micro-Manager seems to recognize the Picard stage with no problem, including theta.  So we use the Acquire SPIM Image? plugin to move the stage around and then we click 'Mark' in the Stage Position dialog window that pops up when you activate Multiple Position (XY) in Multi-D Acquisition.  You could accomplish the same thing by moving the stage using the custom software from Picard; we just find the controls in openSPIM a little easier.  We use 'Relative Z mode' in the Z-stack dialog to capture a volume of desired depth and step size centered on each pre-set X/Y/Z/theta position.

We tried Stephan Priebisch's Multi-View Reconstruction, but without much luck so far.  I have got to the point where it recognizes a few congruencies but not enough to properly align the images.  Mostly I attribute our problem to my not-quite-vertical home-made sample holder.

All the best,


Tim

However, when I try to read in a file created using SPIMAcquisition, ImageJ always thinks the z-spacing is 1 cm (when typically it is 3-5 micrometers).

When MM's Multi-D code encounters a file that would be over the 4GB limit, it breaks it up into multiple files, each less than 4GB. SPIMAcquisition does not do anything different for files over the 4GB limit, which results in an error from the OME package.

In both of these cases, the MM Multi-D behavior matches my needs, whereas the SPIMAcquisition behavior is causing me problems that I have to fix, or workaround in some way. I have been using the SPIM because we have a SPIM microscope, and we need support for a stage that can rotate in Theta, as well as move in X, Y, and Z.

I am posting this first to the SPIM group, although I know this issue involves interfaces between several groups: SPIM, Micro-manager, OME, ImageJ, etc.

I would like to ask the SPIM people if there was a reason for using the OME package for writing TIFF files rather than the MM package?
Because -- I am thinking of customizing my version of the SPIM code to use the MM package instead.

I appreciate thoughts on the reasonableness of doing this customization to the TIFF writing code in SPIM.
I also appreciate any other suggestions people have about better ways to move forward.

I am using the following versions at the moment:
 - Micro-Manager: 1.4.23 20151021
 - ImageJ: 1.50b
 - OpenSPIM: Not sure how to determine this. We originally downloaded the OpenSPIM/Fiji package. I just checked the OpenSPIM downloads page, and it is still listing a download dated 4/26/2015, so that must be the one we used.

Thanks,
Bill Whitney

Indeed it looks like the updated OpenSPIM writes files bigger than 4GB,  
the metadata also looks correct for me.

Hello dear light sheet enthousiaste.

An email to fish advices regarding computer configuration.

I convince my boss that we need a super duper computer to process the spim
data that we are producing and I want to know if the configuration advice
by the open spim website is up to date(description below) or if I
should/could aim for even bigger machine. Online, I also found the HP Z840
that can accomodate a tremendous amount of ram, any recommandation?

We have to choose between buying a work station with massive a amount ram
or our private node on the institute cluster, does anyone has advice or
feedback on previous expererience ?

thank you and may the light sheet be with you

cheers

Hi all,



we have experienced some problems with survival of the larvae when mounted in the FEP tubes. They seems to suffocate after 1-2 h in the tube. Using the same agarose solution but keeping the larvae covered on a glass slide they stay alive and healthy. We are following the protocol for long time imaging from JOVE (Weber et al 2014) but has also tested 0.5% and 1% low melting agarose solutions for embedding. It would be much appreciated to get some input how to solve this issue.



Thanks!

Hey Fredrik,

thanks for watching our JoVE publication :). How old are the larvae you're trying to image? In our hands, FEP works great up to around 3 dpf. With older larvae we also see oxygen deficiency, because the tubes are gas-proof. Currently, those developmental stages are not so interesting for us, so we did not spend much time on optimizing it. We have ideas though, e.g. putting holes in the tube to allow for oxygen diffusion.

Best,
Michael

Hey Thomas,

computer requirements depend a lot on the amount of data you record and process. I would say that having a powerful workstation is important, especially if you are just starting with light sheet microscopy. You are typically dealing with a lot of data that has to be moved around and loaded into software. Only once you have your imaging and processing pipelines set up, it can be transferred to a cluster. You could save some money on the processor, and you also don't need the fastest graphics card (CUDA is nice, though). Aim for enough RAM for your data plus fast hard drive / SSD space for moving data around.

Best,
Michael

Hey Thomas,


in addition to Michael?s remarks, I?d like to add that the graphics cards in your listing are quite dated, but anyway still expensive ? I found them for around 1000EUR online.


If you plan on running things like Multiview Deconvolution (http://fiji.sc/Multi-View_Deconvolution) on the GPU, you?d probably be better off getting a more recent card, like a GeForce Titan X with 12 GB RAM, instead. That card also costs around 1000EUR.


The main difference (apart from the Titan X having a much more recent architecture) between the two is the double precision calculation speed: The consumer (read non-Quadro) cards are artificially capped at 1/8th of the single precision processing speed. For most image processing tasks however, double precision is not necessary, but more RAM on the GPU helps tremendously.


Hope that helped :)


cheers!

Hi OpenSpim Community,

We at LLNL am interested in developing light sheet microscopy for host-pathogen interactions.
We would like to do cellular imaging and not so much tissue or embryonic imaging.
Would the OpenSpim setup be suitable for this?  In addition, we have some other questions:

1.       What is the highest N.A. objective we can use?
2.       Can we incorporate Bessel beam, or even lattice light sheet like Eric Betzig's group?
3.       Are there an advantages of using stepper motors for scanning, and not galvo-mirrors?  Can galvos be used instead?

Thank you.

Thanks guys,

so I already have a pipeline working on the cluster but our problem is that
the priority rules for the jobs have been establish many years ago without
taking into account the needs of image analyst (lot of ram for a short
time) which lead to unexpected and unpleasant delays in the processing
(wait 2 weeks for a 2h job is a bit excessive). Two solutions make a
smarter pipeline or buy a big computer, I would rather go for option number
two.

I the end I will push for a workstation more than a private node on the
cluster because you can do the maintenance yourself  and even thought we
don't use GPU calculation at the moment it would be nice to keep this door
open.

I will ask for a quote to HP for the configuration below if someone is
interested.

Small question, linux kind of have a repulsive effect on brave biologist
exploring biophysics, is there any downside to use windows 8.1 instead of
linux ?

thanks

thomas

Hi Sonny,

I suspect the key challenge will be mounting your cells in the OpenSPIM 
geometry.  But there are light sheet microscopes built around a 
horizontal sample mount, including diSPIM, lattice light sheet, and 
Leica's confocal add-on.

For the diSPIM (http://dispim.org/) it is possible to use a NA 1.0 or 
1.1 objective if the usual 0.8 NA isn't enough.  It's also possible to 
incorporate Bessel beam, etc.  I'm happy to answer further questions but 
we should move off this mailing list.

Hi Michael,

Thanks for your reply and confirmation of the problem with hypoxia. We evaluate larvae from day 7 to 10 since we like to correlate imaging analysis with behavioral response. Please keep me updated if you do solve the issue.

Best,

Fredrik

Hey Fredrik,

thanks for watching our JoVE publication :). How old are the larvae you're trying to image? In our hands, FEP works great up to around 3 dpf. With older larvae we also see oxygen deficiency, because the tubes are gas-proof. Currently, those developmental stages are not so interesting for us, so we did not spend much time on optimizing it. We have ideas though, e.g. putting holes in the tube to allow for oxygen diffusion.

Best,
Michael

Hi all,


we have experienced some problems with survival of the larvae when mounted in the FEP tubes. They seems to suffocate after 1-2 h in the tube. Using the same agarose solution but keeping the larvae covered on a glass slide they stay alive and healthy. We are following the protocol for long time imaging from JOVE (Weber et al 2014) but has also tested 0.5% and 1% low melting agarose solutions for embedding. It would be much appreciated to get some input how to solve this issue.


Thanks!

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF
	packages?
Message-ID: <CAD9Sw22PK6vwsS3mvPQg=aYLJV_wCZCHy-mvW1TdPN1Fkk+1cQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have discovered that if I image a Z-stack using Micro-Manager's multi-D
acquisition, the TIFF file generated differs from what I get if I image the
Z-stack using SPIMAcquisition.

Here is what I have discovered so far:

   - MM's Multi-D acquisition uses a micro-manager package,
   namely org.micromanager.acquisition.TaggedImageStorageMultipageTiff, which
   implements the interface org.micromanager.api.TaggedImageStorage
   - OpenSPIM uses packages from OME (Open Microscopy Environment),
   including loci.formats.IFormatWriter,  loci.formats.ImageWriter,
    loci.common.services.ServiceFactory,  loci.formats.MetadataTools,  etc.
   - The two packages write metadata to the TIFF file differently. The main
   difference that is impacting me right now is the metadata for the physical
   space separation between Z slices. Both packages arguably write "CORRECT"
   metadata to the TIFF file, but in different ways. When I read the file  in
   later using ImageJ, or the ImageJ plugin BigDataViewer, the z-spacing info
   is read correctly for the MM Multi-D file. However, when I try to read in a
   file created using SPIMAcquisition, ImageJ always thinks the z-spacing is 1
   cm (when typically it is 3-5 micrometers).
   - The two packages also behave differently for LARGE files. The
   definition of the TIFF file format limits files to no more than 4GB. When
   MM's Multi-D code encounters a file that would be over the 4GB limit, it
   breaks it up into multiple files, each less than 4GB. SPIMAcquisition does
   not do anything different for files over the 4GB limit, which results in an
   error from the OME package. The OME package does support large files via
   switching from TIFF format to BIGTIFF format, but the calling code has to
    specify that. I was able to customize the SPIM code to do this, but the
   resulting BIGTIFF file proved to be unusable in ImageJ.

In both of these cases, the MM Multi-D behavior matches my needs, whereas
the SPIMAcquisition behavior is causing me problems that I have to fix, or
workaround in some way. I have been using the SPIM because we have a SPIM
microscope, and we need support for a stage that can rotate in Theta, as
well as move in X, Y, and Z.

I am posting this first to the SPIM group, although I know this issue
involves interfaces between several groups: SPIM, Micro-manager, OME,
ImageJ, etc.

I would like to ask the SPIM people if there was a reason for using the OME
package for writing TIFF files rather than the MM package?
Because -- I am thinking of customizing my version of the SPIM code to use
the MM package instead.

I appreciate thoughts on the reasonableness of doing this customization to
the TIFF writing code in SPIM.
I also appreciate any other suggestions people have about better ways to
move forward.

I am using the following versions at the moment:
 - Micro-Manager: 1.4.23 20151021
 - ImageJ: 1.50b
 - OpenSPIM: Not sure how to determine this. We originally downloaded the
OpenSPIM/Fiji package. I just checked the OpenSPIM downloads page, and it
is still listing a download dated 4/26/2015, so that must be the one we
used.

Thanks,
Bill Whitney

Hi Bill,

Is that necessary?  We use Multi-D Acquisition because our SPIM has two lasers, and in my experience the mult-stage position mode handles sample rotation well.  Maybe I am missing something in your plan.

Hi Bill,

I think SPIMAcquistion was intended to be compatible with Fiji seamlessly. That is why it uses OME TIFF package.
Recently, we have updated SPIMAcquisition before Christmas in order to support HDF5 export and fix Anti-Drift.
The update contains the fix for “over 4GB tiffs” too.
Please, update and give it a try.

For the z-space, you can specify z-space and click “stack at this Z plus:”.
Each stack contains the z-space based on what you enter.
The pixel calibration is also crucial for having the correct Metadata which will be read by image readers in Fiji.




Thank you for your comments.
Please, let us know if you have any feature request and/or feedback.

Cheers,
HongKee

Hi Tim,

Could I ask you to elaborate on your usage of the multi-stage position in MM Multi-D?  I'm setting up a 2-color SPIM, and wondered how you take your data.

In looking at the Multi-D I see that I can set different 'z' positions of the Twister stage.  I assume you just setup a few positions with different offsets?

Also, I'm confused by the acquisition order...  I'm used to seeing channel then z-position then xy location and then time lapse (for example).  Is the logic reversed in the options in MM?

If it's easier, and you ok with it, maybe you could send a copy of your acquisition settings for me to take a look at?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi Neil,

Our process is pretty simple.  Micro-Manager seems to recognize the Picard stage with no problem, including theta.  So we use the Acquire SPIM Image… plugin to move the stage around and then we click 'Mark' in the Stage Position dialog window that pops up when you activate Multiple Position (XY) in Multi-D Acquisition.  You could accomplish the same thing by moving the stage using the custom software from Picard; we just find the controls in openSPIM a little easier.  We use 'Relative Z mode' in the Z-stack dialog to capture a volume of desired depth and step size centered on each pre-set X/Y/Z/theta position.

We tried Stephan Priebisch's Multi-View Reconstruction, but without much luck so far.  I have got to the point where it recognizes a few congruencies but not enough to properly align the images.  Mostly I attribute our problem to my not-quite-vertical home-made sample holder.

All the best,


Tim

Also, I’m confused by the acquisition order…  I’m used to seeing channel then z-position then xy location and then time lapse (for example).  Is the logic reversed in the options in MM?

If it’s easier, and you ok with it, maybe you could send a copy of your acquisition settings for me to take a look at?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi Bill,

Is that necessary?  We use Multi-D Acquisition because our SPIM has two lasers, and in my experience the mult-stage position mode handles sample rotation well.  Maybe I am missing something in your plan.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF packages?

I have discovered that if I image a Z-stack using Micro-Manager's multi-D acquisition, the TIFF file generated differs from what I get if I image the Z-stack using SPIMAcquisition.

Here is what I have discovered so far:

  *   MM's Multi-D acquisition uses a micro-manager package, namely org.micromanager.acquisition.TaggedImageStorageMultipageTiff, which implements the interface org.micromanager.api.TaggedImageStorage
  *   OpenSPIM uses packages from OME (Open Microscopy Environment), including loci.formats.IFormatWriter,  loci.formats.ImageWriter,  loci.common.services.ServiceFactory,  loci.formats.MetadataTools,  etc.
  *   The two packages write metadata to the TIFF file differently. The main difference that is impacting me right now is the metadata for the physical space separation between Z slices. Both packages arguably write "CORRECT" metadata to the TIFF file, but in different ways. When I read the file  in later using ImageJ, or the ImageJ plugin BigDataViewer, the z-spacing info is read correctly for the MM Multi-D file. However, when I try to read in a file created using SPIMAcquisition, ImageJ always thinks the z-spacing is 1 cm (when typically it is 3-5 micrometers).
  *   The two packages also behave differently for LARGE files. The definition of the TIFF file format limits files to no more than 4GB. When MM's Multi-D code encounters a file that would be over the 4GB limit, it breaks it up into multiple files, each less than 4GB. SPIMAcquisition does not do anything different for files over the 4GB limit, which results in an error from the OME package. The OME package does support large files via switching from TIFF format to BIGTIFF format, but the calling code has to  specify that. I was able to customize the SPIM code to do this, but the resulting BIGTIFF file proved to be unusable in ImageJ.
In both of these cases, the MM Multi-D behavior matches my needs, whereas the SPIMAcquisition behavior is causing me problems that I have to fix, or workaround in some way. I have been using the SPIM because we have a SPIM microscope, and we need support for a stage that can rotate in Theta, as well as move in X, Y, and Z.

I am posting this first to the SPIM group, although I know this issue involves interfaces between several groups: SPIM, Micro-manager, OME, ImageJ, etc.

I would like to ask the SPIM people if there was a reason for using the OME package for writing TIFF files rather than the MM package?
Because -- I am thinking of customizing my version of the SPIM code to use the MM package instead.

I appreciate thoughts on the reasonableness of doing this customization to the TIFF writing code in SPIM.
I also appreciate any other suggestions people have about better ways to move forward.

I am using the following versions at the moment:
 - Micro-Manager: 1.4.23 20151021
 - ImageJ: 1.50b
 - OpenSPIM: Not sure how to determine this. We originally downloaded the OpenSPIM/Fiji package. I just checked the OpenSPIM downloads page, and it is still listing a download dated 4/26/2015, so that must be the one we used.

Thanks,
Bill Whitney

Indeed it looks like the updated OpenSPIM writes files bigger than 4GB,  
the metadata also looks correct for me.

Hello dear light sheet enthousiaste.

An email to fish advices regarding computer configuration.

I convince my boss that we need a super duper computer to process the spim
data that we are producing and I want to know if the configuration advice
by the open spim website is up to date(description below) or if I
should/could aim for even bigger machine. Online, I also found the HP Z840
that can accomodate a tremendous amount of ram, any recommandation?

We have to choose between buying a work station with massive a amount ram
or our private node on the institute cluster, does anyone has advice or
feedback on previous expererience ?

thank you and may the light sheet be with you

cheers

Hi all,



we have experienced some problems with survival of the larvae when mounted in the FEP tubes. They seems to suffocate after 1-2 h in the tube. Using the same agarose solution but keeping the larvae covered on a glass slide they stay alive and healthy. We are following the protocol for long time imaging from JOVE (Weber et al 2014) but has also tested 0.5% and 1% low melting agarose solutions for embedding. It would be much appreciated to get some input how to solve this issue.



Thanks!

Hey Fredrik,

thanks for watching our JoVE publication :). How old are the larvae you're trying to image? In our hands, FEP works great up to around 3 dpf. With older larvae we also see oxygen deficiency, because the tubes are gas-proof. Currently, those developmental stages are not so interesting for us, so we did not spend much time on optimizing it. We have ideas though, e.g. putting holes in the tube to allow for oxygen diffusion.

Best,
Michael

Hey Thomas,

computer requirements depend a lot on the amount of data you record and process. I would say that having a powerful workstation is important, especially if you are just starting with light sheet microscopy. You are typically dealing with a lot of data that has to be moved around and loaded into software. Only once you have your imaging and processing pipelines set up, it can be transferred to a cluster. You could save some money on the processor, and you also don't need the fastest graphics card (CUDA is nice, though). Aim for enough RAM for your data plus fast hard drive / SSD space for moving data around.

Best,
Michael

Hey Thomas,


in addition to Michael’s remarks, I’d like to add that the graphics cards in your listing are quite dated, but anyway still expensive — I found them for around 1000EUR online.


If you plan on running things like Multiview Deconvolution (http://fiji.sc/Multi-View_Deconvolution) on the GPU, you’d probably be better off getting a more recent card, like a GeForce Titan X with 12 GB RAM, instead. That card also costs around 1000EUR.


The main difference (apart from the Titan X having a much more recent architecture) between the two is the double precision calculation speed: The consumer (read non-Quadro) cards are artificially capped at 1/8th of the single precision processing speed. For most image processing tasks however, double precision is not necessary, but more RAM on the GPU helps tremendously.


Hope that helped :)


cheers!

Hi OpenSpim Community,

We at LLNL am interested in developing light sheet microscopy for host-pathogen interactions.
We would like to do cellular imaging and not so much tissue or embryonic imaging.
Would the OpenSpim setup be suitable for this?  In addition, we have some other questions:

1.       What is the highest N.A. objective we can use?
2.       Can we incorporate Bessel beam, or even lattice light sheet like Eric Betzig's group?
3.       Are there an advantages of using stepper motors for scanning, and not galvo-mirrors?  Can galvos be used instead?

Thank you.

Thanks guys,

so I already have a pipeline working on the cluster but our problem is that
the priority rules for the jobs have been establish many years ago without
taking into account the needs of image analyst (lot of ram for a short
time) which lead to unexpected and unpleasant delays in the processing
(wait 2 weeks for a 2h job is a bit excessive). Two solutions make a
smarter pipeline or buy a big computer, I would rather go for option number
two.

I the end I will push for a workstation more than a private node on the
cluster because you can do the maintenance yourself  and even thought we
don't use GPU calculation at the moment it would be nice to keep this door
open.

I will ask for a quote to HP for the configuration below if someone is
interested.

Small question, linux kind of have a repulsive effect on brave biologist
exploring biophysics, is there any downside to use windows 8.1 instead of
linux ?

thanks

thomas

Hi Sonny,

I suspect the key challenge will be mounting your cells in the OpenSPIM 
geometry.  But there are light sheet microscopes built around a 
horizontal sample mount, including diSPIM, lattice light sheet, and 
Leica's confocal add-on.

For the diSPIM (http://dispim.org/) it is possible to use a NA 1.0 or 
1.1 objective if the usual 0.8 NA isn't enough.  It's also possible to 
incorporate Bessel beam, etc.  I'm happy to answer further questions but 
we should move off this mailing list.

Hi Michael,

Thanks for your reply and confirmation of the problem with hypoxia. We evaluate larvae from day 7 to 10 since we like to correlate imaging analysis with behavioral response. Please keep me updated if you do solve the issue.

Best,

Fredrik

Ämne: Re: [OpenSPIM] survival FEP Tubes

Hey Fredrik,

thanks for watching our JoVE publication :). How old are the larvae you're trying to image? In our hands, FEP works great up to around 3 dpf. With older larvae we also see oxygen deficiency, because the tubes are gas-proof. Currently, those developmental stages are not so interesting for us, so we did not spend much time on optimizing it. We have ideas though, e.g. putting holes in the tube to allow for oxygen diffusion.

Best,
Michael

Hi all,


we have experienced some problems with survival of the larvae when mounted in the FEP tubes. They seems to suffocate after 1-2 h in the tube. Using the same agarose solution but keeping the larvae covered on a glass slide they stay alive and healthy. We are following the protocol for long time imaging from JOVE (Weber et al 2014) but has also tested 0.5% and 1% low melting agarose solutions for embedding. It would be much appreciated to get some input how to solve this issue.


Thanks!


Fredrik
