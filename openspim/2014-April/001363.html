<PRE>Hi Martin,

Sorry about the delay.

Could you please clarify how it does not work? When in Hardware Configuration, is the 'Andor' device not listed? Is it listed, but with a gray dot next to it? Is it available, but gives an error when you try to add it?


Which instructions did you follow, exactly? And did the Dependency Walker show any errors?


&gt;<i> Could anybody help me, please? What is the number of MM version used in the OpenSPIM from February 7 2014 ? I see only 1.4.x dev, which is probably not enough to choose the proper one.
</I>

As near as I can determine, OpenSPIM from 7 Feb 2014 is based on[1] Micro-Manager v1.4.16 (which was released 31 January, 2014). This means that copying DLLs from that version of Micro-Manager to OpenSPIM's mm/win32 directory should work. If it does not, please try downloading the nightly build from 5 February 2014[2]:


- From the Micro-Manager website, click 'Downloads'.
- On the left, click 'Download Nightly Builds'.
- Click 'Version 1.4 (Windows)'.
- Scroll through the list looking for 'MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe'.


That version of Micro-Manager should be completely compatible with OpenSPIM.


I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you continue to run into problems.


Thanks,
Luke


[1] To be completely precise, it is based on SVN revision r12726, dated 5 February 2014. This was shortly after the release of 1.4.16 as I mention above.
[2] The direct link is: <A HREF="http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe">http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe</A> -- however, please always beware of direct links in e-mails! It is safer to find the file yourself, from a trusted website.
