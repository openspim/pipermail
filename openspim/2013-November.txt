Hi Luke,

Yes, the issue happens, at least to me, regardless of the operating system and of the architecture.
I don't know if someone else is facing this issue as well.

I did check the plugin using the no shutter configuration, now any message that the setup
is not complete appears when starting the plugin, but the problem persists.

Yes, the 4 motors are fully functional and all they report the actual position correctly.

I will update Fiji again on monday, and I will let you know what happen. 

Thanks to you,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

So the issue appears regardless of operating system (Windows XP versus Windows 7) and architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit)? Did you try going back to the no-shutter configuration? (It shouldn't have a problem now that I've added some checks for an absent laser.)


I take it all the motor controls are fully functional? That is, the sliders all report the current position correctly, and let you change the position without trouble, for all four stage axes?

I've uploaded another version of the plugin which is a little more direct about its error reporting; please try updating once more -- although this may not fix the issue, it might produce useful error output.


Thanks again,
Luke

 Hi Luke,

Now that I update Fiji again I am not able to start the plugin SPIMage Acquisition. It is so strange because
even using different hardware configurations (D_cam instead of TIS_cam) it doesn't work. :-/

I tried also in the other computer (Win 7, 64 bit) and didn't work as well.

I attach the corelog and the error file although they don't say too much about what is the cause of the problem.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Dear German,

I Cc:ed the mailing list where you have access to more expertise than just
mine.

It is designed for the Orca, but we already had reports of success with
different cameras. Basically, everything supported by Micro-Manager should
work, and as far as I know, Zyla is supported.

Curiouser and curiouser -- not a single error is produced by the plugin launch, and yet it isn't displayed? It certainly seems to be a much deeper issue than I initially suspected.

A different camera adapter had no better luck? Did it too produce an hs_err file that might be different from the others?


Since you aren't using the Cube, you might try enabling the further debug output, if it's not already turned on: From Micro-Manager, click Tools -> Options, and check Debug Log Enabled. This will produce significantly more output in the Core Log. (I say the absence of a Cube is an advantage in this situation; the laser is queried once per second, and in debug logging mode, the messages become difficult to sift through.) With luck, this might provide more detailed information.


Thank you again,
Luke

Hi Luke,

There was not message error and no response when launching the SPIMage acquisition plugin, that was the most surprising.

About the hs_err file all were the same even if I was using the Demo Camera configuration. Only using the Windows 7 64 bit PC I didn't
get any hs_err file.

Today I launch the plugin and it works again, I really don't know why it was not working on monday (even in two different PCs).
Surprisingly I got a message window when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" button. The message was: Couldn't create stack: For input string "3493,500", 
for this case 3493,500 was the currently Z position when pressing the "Stack at this Z plus" button.
Today I didn't get any hs_err file by the way. :-)

I attach two corelog files, in one the debug log option is enabled. In both corelog files the first attempt is using the demo cam hardware configuration,
the secon attempt is using the TIS CAM hardware configuration.

What I could guess from the corelog file is that the problem could be the way the value of the Z position is handled. I am not sure but I think
that this issue started since the resolution in the stage position values are managed as 1,5 um instead of 1 um.

Hope this information is useful. Thanks again.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Curiouser and curiouser -- not a single error is produced by the plugin launch, and yet it isn't displayed? It certainly seems to be a much deeper issue than I initially suspected.

A different camera adapter had no better luck? Did it too produce an hs_err file that might be different from the others?


Since you aren't using the Cube, you might try enabling the further debug output, if it's not already turned on: From Micro-Manager, click Tools -> Options, and check Debug Log Enabled. This will produce significantly more output in the Core Log. (I say the absence of a Cube is an advantage in this situation; the laser is queried once per second, and in debug logging mode, the messages become difficult to sift through.) With luck, this might provide more detailed information.


Thank you again,
Luke

Hi Edgar,

I believe you're correct; this is doubtless a result of the move to actual micrometer units, but to be more precise, I think I'm dealing with the strings in a non-localizable way. Somewhere, I'm trying to parse a floating point number and expecting (demanding) that the delimiter be a period -- which is blatantly unfair of me; I seem to have forgotten that this is far from an international standard! :-) I'll hopefully put out a fix before I leave today, providing I can find the source of the mistake; now that I know what I'm looking for, things should proceed much more smoothly.


Thank you for your patience!
Luke

Hi Luke,

Hopefully that is the root of the issue and you're welcome, thanks for your support.

Hi Edgar,

I just finished uploading a new version of the plugin that should be considerably more locale-conscious. I've checked most of the obvious features under both the German (de-DE) and United States (en-US) locales and noticed no issues. Please let me know if your troubles persist after updating Fiji!


Thanks,
Luke

This will produce significantly more output in the Core Log. (I say the absence of a Cube is an advantage in this situation; the laser is queried once per second, and in debug logging mode, the messages become difficult to sift through.) With luck, this might provide more detailed information.

 Hi Luke,

I am very glad to tell you that the problem was solved. Now everything works perfectly and no error files
are generated. I only would like to know how can I set the speed for the X and Y motors. I already
tried using configuration settings in Micro-Manager adding a Group where I use the Picard XY Stage-X-Velocity
and Picard XY Stage-Y-Velocity and set them to 10 but when moving the X and Y stage, the speed is always
1 so I don't know if this is right the way that the speed should be set.

Thanks a lot. :-)

Kind regards,
Edgar

As far as I know, the appropriate way to set the stage velocity is to click, from Micro-Manager: Tools -> Device/Property Browser, scroll through the list looking for those two properties -- Picard XY Stage-X/Y-Velocity -- and set them as desired. (The mention of groups sounds like you might be specifying them as criteria in a pixel size configuration.) If this isn't working, it may be another localization glitch; please let me know.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

I have tried to set the velocity of the Picard XY Stage-X/Y-Velocity using the Device/Property browser and I set the values to 10, but then when 
I change the stage position using the SPIM plugin the actual velocity is 1 (if I click Refresh on the Device/Property browser then the values are updated
to 1). Looks like the plugin set the properties Picard XY Stage-X-Velocity and Picard XY Stage-Y-Velocity to 1. That doesn't happen with the Picard Z Stage-Velocity
since this property can be set from inside the plugin.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Thanks for pointing out this bug! The problem turned out to be in the device adapter, actually -- it wasn't storing new velocity values, so the next time the stage moved, it used whatever it had been set to before. (Probably, in your configuration file, the stage velocity is being set to '1'; in my case, the velocities were stuck at 10.) I've uploaded a new version of the device adapter to the OpenSPIM update site; updating Fiji should download it and fix the issue.


Thanks again,
Luke

Hi Luke,

You are welcome. Thanks for solving this bug. Now I can set the speed from the X and Y Stage's axis correclty.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Thanks for pointing out this bug! The problem turned out to be in the device adapter, actually -- it wasn't storing new velocity values, so the next time the stage moved, it used whatever it had been set to before. (Probably, in your configuration file, the stage velocity is being set to '1'; in my case, the velocities were stuck at 10.) I've uploaded a new version of the device adapter to the OpenSPIM update site; updating Fiji should download it and fix the issue.


Thanks again,
Luke

(The mention of groups sounds like you might be specifying them as criteria in a pixel size configuration.) If this isn't working, it may be another localization glitch; please let me know.

Message-ID: <528A7FE3.6070104@biz.uni-muenchen.de>

Hi all,

We have started to build up an OpenSPIM set up at the biology department 
in Munich. All parts with the exception of the camera have been ordered 
now. My concern are the problems with the DCAM driver for the 
recommended Orca ER. At the moment a Windows XP operating system is OK 
for us, however on the long run we have to upgrade the operating system. 
Therefore I ask for your advice:

Would you recommend to by the Orca ER and wait for a bug fix?
Are there any plans to integrate other cameras soon?
In the June 2013 archive I read about the COS Heidelberg OpenSPIM 
equipped with an Orca4 camera. Could this be an option for us?

We have only a weak background in programming. Therefore I would prefer 
to stay close to the standard.

Looking forward to your reply,

Hartmann

Hi Chao Hui,

I'm not sure that we have the entire assembly available for download, though I think that can be arranged. Our custom parts all have part files available on the parts list page, but I believe we used part files from the manufacturer for any part we didn't make ourselves. (If a part's SolidWorks file seems to be missing from the parts list, you can check?http://openspim.org/index.php?limit=50&ilsearch=.stl&user=&title=Special%3AListFiles?to see if it is uploaded on the wiki after all.)


I've forwarded your e-mail to our mailing list and to Pete Pitrone, who I believe knows more about the SolidWorks files -- he may be able to provide more information.


Pete: If you haven't already, could you please upload the completed assemblies? Probably they can be linked from?http://openspim.org/Configurations?-- thanks!


Hope this helps,
Luke

I tested the problem and it's just as you explained: the version of Micro-Manager in the ZIP file (1/31) won't snap an image more than once (though I found that by turning live mode on and then off again, it is possible to snap another image). I'm not certain what causes this problem, however, and it doesn't happen in the latest version (which is now on Github). You should be able to update the plugin using Help -> Update Fiji (Please be sure you get MMJ_.jar, MMCoreJ.jar, and any new DLL files as well.).

Hi Hartmann,

In theory, the OpenSPIM system should be able to work with any camera Micro-Manager can communicate with. The standard setup's specification of an Orca ER on Windows XP was because it was a combination we knew for a fact worked with MM at the time. Branching out into other cameras carries a certain risk, since we can't personally test all possibilities, but I (and, doubtless, the Micro-Manager mailing list) would be happy to help if you run into any trouble trying to get a certain camera working with Micro-Manager.


Given the above, I would say the answers to the second two questions are "yes" for each -- in that other cameras, the Orca4 included, should already be compatible with OpenSPIM. The?http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F?page has two good examples -- the Heidelberg OpenSPIM using an Orca4, and the Goldstein group at Cambridge using the Photometrics Coolsnap Myo. (As a little advertisement for that page, we'd be delighted if, when your system is completed, you could add it to that list!)


Could you elaborate on the anticipated problems with DCAM on i.e. Windows 7? I'm not familiar with all the issues -- Hamamatsu's website claims the DCAM-API should work on Windows 7 provided certain prerequisites (see?http://dcam-api.com/assets/pdfs/DCAM-API-for-Windows-20131008-Compatibility-Note.pdf?for details) are satisfied.


Thanks,
Luke

Dear Luke,

Appreciate for the arrangement. Truly appreciate.

This is the file we found 
(http://openspim.org/images/d/d1/Solidworks_build_up_3fps_cont_high_res.gif)

Hopefully there is a solidwork file that is available for all users.

Sincerely,

Chao Hui

I tested the problem and it's just as you explained: the version of Micro-Manager in the ZIP file (1/31) won't snap an image more than once (though I found that by turning live mode on and then off again, it is possible to snap another image). I'm not certain what causes this problem, however, and it doesn't happen in the latest version (which is now on Github). You should be able to update the plugin using Help -> Update Fiji (Please be sure you get MMJ_.jar, MMCoreJ.jar, and any new DLL files as well.).

I think Hartmann refers to http://openspim.org/Requirements where we say
that XP is required. IIRC Pete Pitrone tested Windows 7 (inadvertently,
because he got a Windows 7 machine and did not specify that he wanted
Windows XP instead) back in 2011 and after a week of interactive
debugging, we figured out that the DCAM driver back then was not
cooperating nicely with Micro-Manager's DeviceAdapter.

I am pretty certain that those issues have been resolved in the meantime,
though, by a newer DCAM version. In other words, you should be fine if you
download and install the current DCAM.

It would be nice if somebody who does have a Windows 7 machine and an Orce
confirmed that this combination works now, so we can remove that
limitation from the Wiki page.

Anyone?

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

I already tried ORCA R2 + DCAM+ Win7 + micromanager SPIM plugin and it 
works.
(Mind you that I have not tested the complete SPIM setup with Win7. Just 
the camera).
I probably can tell you in January if and what kind of problems I 
encountered using the R2 + Win7 for the SPIM setup.

Robert

Thanks! Once I am on a real computer (not one with a thumbs-only keyboard
and a 2.4 inch screen :-)) I will change the Wiki page.

Unless you beat me to it, that is ;-)

Hi Peter,

Not sure if you remember me, however, we had a burger together in Manchester after a few drinks at EMC.

I've now moved from NIBSC and am director of the Centre for Ultrastructural Imaging at KCL (London).  My SPIM system is finally ready and I'd appreciate a new password to access the site and a change to discuss the plans I have for the system.

Trust you're well. Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Luke,
Hi Johannes
Thank you very much for answering my questions and for offering your 
help if we run into problems with the camera. Indeed my concern in using 
the Orca-ER2 refers to the page http://openspim.org/Requirements and in 
addition to 
http://openspim.org/FAQ#Can_I_run_OpenSPIM_with_Windows_7_or_8.3F

After some discussions in our group we  have now decided to buy the Orca 
4 camera.  I hope that we can add our system soon to the 
http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F page!

I will keep you informed.

Thanks
Hartmann

The standard setup's specification of an Orca ER on Windows XP was because it was a combination we knew for a fact worked with MM at the time. Branching out into other cameras carries a certain risk, since we can't personally test all possibilities, but I (and, doubtless, the Micro-Manager mailing list) would be happy to help if you run into any trouble trying to get a certain camera working with Micro-Manager.

The http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F page has two good examples -- the Heidelberg OpenSPIM using an Orca4, and the Goldstein group at Cambridge using the Photometrics Coolsnap Myo. (As a little advertisement for that page, we'd be delighted if, when your system is completed, you could add it to that list!)

I updated the Wiki. Please note that time I have to spend updating
the Wiki is time I cannot spend writing code ;-) So next time, you might
want to consider editing the Wiki yourself and giving me more time to work
on Fiji and the OpenSPIM software.

Ciao,
Johannes

I concur!
I requested files 3 months ago and got lost in a discussion of file formats.
Pete, what file formats do you have available?

Thanks

Neil,

Sorry about that, I should have done what I said I would then and there.

If you have access to SolidWorks, you can use this Pack-n-go .ZIP file:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39391799/OpenSPIM.zip

If you do not, then you can download this:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39391799/OpenSPIM.STEP .STEP is what
we had discussed to be the most widely used format across platforms. The
problem with this though is that there are rebuild errors on the pars
from Picard and Thorlabs.

I hope that this helps,
Pete

Hi everyone,

Steffen Lemke, J-F Evers and myself have been offering for the last two weeks a course on live imaging and analysis of morphogenesis in Santiago (Chile). We took this opportunity to present and feature the OpenSPIM initiative. Among other activities, the students built and used two OpenSPIMs that are replicates of the machines present in Heidelberg . This was also the opportunity to setup the first OpenSPIM (and first SPIM?) in south america; indeed one of the device we brought will stay in Chile. Our evangelisation campaign has been quite successful  and the interest is very high, I anticipate more OpenSPIMs to popup here. 
The summer school was co-organized by Heidelberg University and Universidad de Chile and finished by a two days international symposium on morphogenesis.

 and  to the accompanying symposium:

Hi Alexis,

Very cool. Thanks for the great work and the report.

I shall make a news item on the wiki (or feel free to do so yourself).

All the best

Hmm, out of curiosity: why put this on DropBox when we have a fine server

Hi Luke,

Yes, the issue happens, at least to me, regardless of the operating system and of the architecture.
I don't know if someone else is facing this issue as well.

I did check the plugin using the no shutter configuration, now any message that the setup
is not complete appears when starting the plugin, but the problem persists.

Yes, the 4 motors are fully functional and all they report the actual position correctly.

I will update Fiji again on monday, and I will let you know what happen. 

Thanks to you,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

So the issue appears regardless of operating system (Windows XP versus Windows 7) and architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit)? Did you try going back to the no-shutter configuration? (It shouldn't have a problem now that I've added some checks for an absent laser.)


I take it all the motor controls are fully functional? That is, the sliders all report the current position correctly, and let you change the position without trouble, for all four stage axes?

I've uploaded another version of the plugin which is a little more direct about its error reporting; please try updating once more -- although this may not fix the issue, it might produce useful error output.


Thanks again,
Luke

(Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.

Can it be un-stuck and clicked on again? It's still possible that there is a silent exception being generated; I'll check on that.

 Hi Luke,

Now that I update Fiji again I am not able to start the plugin SPIMage Acquisition. It is so strange because
even using different hardware configurations (D_cam instead of TIS_cam) it doesn't work. :-/

I tried also in the other computer (Win 7, 64 bit) and didn't work as well.

I attach the corelog and the error file although they don't say too much about what is the cause of the problem.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Luke,

Yes, the issue happens, at least to me, regardless of the operating system and of the architecture.
I don't know if someone else is facing this issue as well.

I did check the plugin using the no shutter configuration, now any message that the setup
is not complete appears when starting the plugin, but the problem persists.

Yes, the 4 motors are fully functional and all they report the actual position correctly.

I will update Fiji again on monday, and I will let you know what happen. 

Thanks to you,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

So the issue appears regardless of operating system (Windows XP versus Windows 7) and architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit)? Did you try going back to the no-shutter configuration? (It shouldn't have a problem now that I've added some checks for an absent laser.)


I take it all the motor controls are fully functional? That is, the sliders all report the current position correctly, and let you change the position without trouble, for all four stage axes?

I've uploaded another version of the plugin which is a little more direct about its error reporting; please try updating once more -- although this may not fix the issue, it might produce useful error output.


Thanks again,
Luke

(Most of the hardware errors point into TIScam's extra DLL -- TIS_DShowLib10.dll+0x2eced.) I will eventually need to do some digging to try and discern the source of that error; however, I'm not convinced it's the cause of the stack insert problem (another symptom of the problem, perhaps) -- if the software isn't crashing when you click the button, then these files are probably being generated when Micro-Manager is closed.

It is designed for the Orca, but we already had reports of success with
different cameras. Basically, everything supported by Micro-Manager should
work, and as far as I know, Zyla is supported.

Curiouser and curiouser -- not a single error is produced by the plugin launch, and yet it isn't displayed? It certainly seems to be a much deeper issue than I initially suspected.

A different camera adapter had no better luck? Did it too produce an hs_err file that might be different from the others?


Since you aren't using the Cube, you might try enabling the further debug output, if it's not already turned on: From Micro-Manager, click Tools -> Options, and check Debug Log Enabled. This will produce significantly more output in the Core Log. (I say the absence of a Cube is an advantage in this situation; the laser is queried once per second, and in debug logging mode, the messages become difficult to sift through.) With luck, this might provide more detailed information.


Thank you again,
Luke

Hi Luke,

There was not message error and no response when launching the SPIMage acquisition plugin, that was the most surprising.

About the hs_err file all were the same even if I was using the Demo Camera configuration. Only using the Windows 7 64 bit PC I didn't
get any hs_err file.

Today I launch the plugin and it works again, I really don't know why it was not working on monday (even in two different PCs).
Surprisingly I got a message window when pressing "Stack at this Z plus" button. The message was: Couldn't create stack: For input string "3493,500", 
for this case 3493,500 was the currently Z position when pressing the "Stack at this Z plus" button.
Today I didn't get any hs_err file by the way. :-)

I attach two corelog files, in one the debug log option is enabled. In both corelog files the first attempt is using the demo cam hardware configuration,
the secon attempt is using the TIS CAM hardware configuration.

What I could guess from the corelog file is that the problem could be the way the value of the Z position is handled. I am not sure but I think
that this issue started since the resolution in the stage position values are managed as 1,5 um instead of 1 um.

Hope this information is useful. Thanks again.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

I believe you're correct; this is doubtless a result of the move to actual micrometer units, but to be more precise, I think I'm dealing with the strings in a non-localizable way. Somewhere, I'm trying to parse a floating point number and expecting (demanding) that the delimiter be a period -- which is blatantly unfair of me; I seem to have forgotten that this is far from an international standard! :-) I'll hopefully put out a fix before I leave today, providing I can find the source of the mistake; now that I know what I'm looking for, things should proceed much more smoothly.


Thank you for your patience!
Luke

Hi Luke,

Hopefully that is the root of the issue and you're welcome, thanks for your support.

Hi Edgar,

I just finished uploading a new version of the plugin that should be considerably more locale-conscious. I've checked most of the obvious features under both the German (de-DE) and United States (en-US) locales and noticed no issues. Please let me know if your troubles persist after updating Fiji!


Thanks,
Luke

 Hi Luke,

I am very glad to tell you that the problem was solved. Now everything works perfectly and no error files
are generated. I only would like to know how can I set the speed for the X and Y motors. I already
tried using configuration settings in Micro-Manager adding a Group where I use the Picard XY Stage-X-Velocity
and Picard XY Stage-Y-Velocity and set them to 10 but when moving the X and Y stage, the speed is always
1 so I don't know if this is right the way that the speed should be set.

Thanks a lot. :-)

Kind regards,
Edgar

As far as I know, the appropriate way to set the stage velocity is to click, from Micro-Manager: Tools -> Device/Property Browser, scroll through the list looking for those two properties -- Picard XY Stage-X/Y-Velocity -- and set them as desired. (The mention of groups sounds like you might be specifying them as criteria in a pixel size configuration.) If this isn't working, it may be another localization glitch; please let me know.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

I have tried to set the velocity of the Picard XY Stage-X/Y-Velocity using the Device/Property browser and I set the values to 10, but then when 
I change the stage position using the SPIM plugin the actual velocity is 1 (if I click Refresh on the Device/Property browser then the values are updated
to 1). Looks like the plugin set the properties Picard XY Stage-X-Velocity and Picard XY Stage-Y-Velocity to 1. That doesn't happen with the Picard Z Stage-Velocity
since this property can be set from inside the plugin.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

Thanks for pointing out this bug! The problem turned out to be in the device adapter, actually -- it wasn't storing new velocity values, so the next time the stage moved, it used whatever it had been set to before. (Probably, in your configuration file, the stage velocity is being set to '1'; in my case, the velocities were stuck at 10.) I've uploaded a new version of the device adapter to the OpenSPIM update site; updating Fiji should download it and fix the issue.


Thanks again,
Luke

Hi Luke,

You are welcome. Thanks for solving this bug. Now I can set the speed from the X and Y Stage's axis correclty.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Camera for OpenSPIM
Message-ID: <528A7FE3.6070104@biz.uni-muenchen.de>

Hi all,

We have started to build up an OpenSPIM set up at the biology department 
in Munich. All parts with the exception of the camera have been ordered 
now. My concern are the problems with the DCAM driver for the 
recommended Orca ER. At the moment a Windows XP operating system is OK 
for us, however on the long run we have to upgrade the operating system. 
Therefore I ask for your advice:

Would you recommend to by the Orca ER and wait for a bug fix?
Are there any plans to integrate other cameras soon?
In the June 2013 archive I read about the COS Heidelberg OpenSPIM 
equipped with an Orca4 camera. Could this be an option for us?

We have only a weak background in programming. Therefore I would prefer 
to stay close to the standard.

Looking forward to your reply,

Hartmann

Hi Chao Hui,

I'm not sure that we have the entire assembly available for download, though I think that can be arranged. Our custom parts all have part files available on the parts list page, but I believe we used part files from the manufacturer for any part we didn't make ourselves. (If a part's SolidWorks file seems to be missing from the parts list, you can check http://openspim.org/index.php?limit=50&ilsearch=.stl&user=&title=Special%3AListFiles to see if it is uploaded on the wiki after all.)


I've forwarded your e-mail to our mailing list and to Pete Pitrone, who I believe knows more about the SolidWorks files -- he may be able to provide more information.


Pete: If you haven't already, could you please upload the completed assemblies? Probably they can be linked from http://openspim.org/Configurations -- thanks!


Hope this helps,
Luke

I tested the problem and it's just as you explained: the version of Micro-Manager in the ZIP file (1/31) won't snap an image more than once (though I found that by turning live mode on and then off again, it is possible to snap another image). I'm not certain what causes this problem, however, and it doesn't happen in the latest version (which is now on Github). You should be able to update the plugin using Help -> Update Fiji (Please be sure you get MMJ_.jar, MMCoreJ.jar, and any new DLL files as well.).

Hi Hartmann,

In theory, the OpenSPIM system should be able to work with any camera Micro-Manager can communicate with. The standard setup's specification of an Orca ER on Windows XP was because it was a combination we knew for a fact worked with MM at the time. Branching out into other cameras carries a certain risk, since we can't personally test all possibilities, but I (and, doubtless, the Micro-Manager mailing list) would be happy to help if you run into any trouble trying to get a certain camera working with Micro-Manager.


Given the above, I would say the answers to the second two questions are "yes" for each -- in that other cameras, the Orca4 included, should already be compatible with OpenSPIM. The http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F page has two good examples -- the Heidelberg OpenSPIM using an Orca4, and the Goldstein group at Cambridge using the Photometrics Coolsnap Myo. (As a little advertisement for that page, we'd be delighted if, when your system is completed, you could add it to that list!)


Could you elaborate on the anticipated problems with DCAM on i.e. Windows 7? I'm not familiar with all the issues -- Hamamatsu's website claims the DCAM-API should work on Windows 7 provided certain prerequisites (see http://dcam-api.com/assets/pdfs/DCAM-API-for-Windows-20131008-Compatibility-Note.pdf for details) are satisfied.


Thanks,
Luke

Dear Luke,

Appreciate for the arrangement. Truly appreciate.

This is the file we found 
(http://openspim.org/images/d/d1/Solidworks_build_up_3fps_cont_high_res.gif)

Hopefully there is a solidwork file that is available for all users.

Sincerely,

Chao Hui

I think Hartmann refers to http://openspim.org/Requirements where we say
that XP is required. IIRC Pete Pitrone tested Windows 7 (inadvertently,
because he got a Windows 7 machine and did not specify that he wanted
Windows XP instead) back in 2011 and after a week of interactive
debugging, we figured out that the DCAM driver back then was not
cooperating nicely with Micro-Manager's DeviceAdapter.

I am pretty certain that those issues have been resolved in the meantime,
though, by a newer DCAM version. In other words, you should be fine if you
download and install the current DCAM.

It would be nice if somebody who does have a Windows 7 machine and an Orce
confirmed that this combination works now, so we can remove that
limitation from the Wiki page.

Anyone?

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

I already tried ORCA R2 + DCAM+ Win7 + micromanager SPIM plugin and it 
works.
(Mind you that I have not tested the complete SPIM setup with Win7. Just 
the camera).
I probably can tell you in January if and what kind of problems I 
encountered using the R2 + Win7 for the SPIM setup.

Robert

Thanks! Once I am on a real computer (not one with a thumbs-only keyboard
and a 2.4 inch screen :-)) I will change the Wiki page.

Unless you beat me to it, that is ;-)

Hi Peter,

Not sure if you remember me, however, we had a burger together in Manchester after a few drinks at EMC.

I've now moved from NIBSC and am director of the Centre for Ultrastructural Imaging at KCL (London).  My SPIM system is finally ready and I'd appreciate a new password to access the site and a change to discuss the plans I have for the system.

Trust you're well. Look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes

Hi Luke,
Hi Johannes
Thank you very much for answering my questions and for offering your 
help if we run into problems with the camera. Indeed my concern in using 
the Orca-ER2 refers to the page http://openspim.org/Requirements and in 
addition to 
http://openspim.org/FAQ#Can_I_run_OpenSPIM_with_Windows_7_or_8.3F

After some discussions in our group we  have now decided to buy the Orca 
4 camera.  I hope that we can add our system soon to the 
http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F page!

I will keep you informed.

Thanks
Hartmann

The standard setup's specification of an Orca ER on Windows XP was because it was a combination we knew for a fact worked with MM at the time. Branching out into other cameras carries a certain risk, since we can't personally test all possibilities, but I (and, doubtless, the Micro-Manager mailing list) would be happy to help if you run into any trouble trying to get a certain camera working with Micro-Manager.

The http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F page has two good examples -- the Heidelberg OpenSPIM using an Orca4, and the Goldstein group at Cambridge using the Photometrics Coolsnap Myo. (As a little advertisement for that page, we'd be delighted if, when your system is completed, you could add it to that list!)

I updated the Wiki. Please note that time I have to spend updating
the Wiki is time I cannot spend writing code ;-) So next time, you might
want to consider editing the Wiki yourself and giving me more time to work
on Fiji and the OpenSPIM software.

Neil,

Sorry about that, I should have done what I said I would then and there.

If you have access to SolidWorks, you can use this Pack-n-go .ZIP file:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39391799/OpenSPIM.zip

If you do not, then you can download this:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39391799/OpenSPIM.STEP .STEP is what
we had discussed to be the most widely used format across platforms. The
problem with this though is that there are rebuild errors on the pars
from Picard and Thorlabs.

I hope that this helps,
Pete

Hi everyone,

Steffen Lemke, J-F Evers and myself have been offering for the last two weeks a course on live imaging and analysis of morphogenesis in Santiago (Chile). We took this opportunity to present and feature the OpenSPIM initiative. Among other activities, the students built and used two OpenSPIMs that are replicates of the machines present in Heidelberg . This was also the opportunity to setup the first OpenSPIM (and first SPIM?) in south america; indeed one of the device we brought will stay in Chile. Our evangelisation campaign has been quite successful  and the interest is very high, I anticipate more OpenSPIMs to popup here. 
The summer school was co-organized by Heidelberg University and Universidad de Chile and finished by a two days international symposium on morphogenesis. 

Link to the summer school: http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/research/international/santander_summer_schools/2013_getting_in_shape.html
 and  to the accompanying symposium:
http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/research/international/santander_summer_schools/2013_symposium_getting_in_shape.html

There is a article in the national newspaper: http://www.latercera.com/noticia/tendencias/2013/11/659-553744-9-chile-tiene-el-primer-microscopio-en-3d-de-latinoamerica.shtml

Hi Alexis,

Very cool. Thanks for the great work and the report.

I shall make a news item on the wiki (or feel free to do so yourself).

All the best
