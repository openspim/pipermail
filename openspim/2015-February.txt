Subject: [OpenSPIM] SPIMAcquisition plugin installation fails
Message-ID: <54D8D259.8060109@rz.hu-berlin.de>

Hi everybody,

I have a problem installing the SPIM acquisition plugin as decribed in 
'https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition' and I need help to 
interpret the error messages. I am not experienced and just started with 
doing such things like building plugins from a local repository. So far 
not really successful...

As described on github I used Maven for a local repository. The error 
comes with the last builing command '|mvn -Dscijava.enforce.skip'; not 
immediately but just after 8 minutes.

here the error message:

It looks like you are using a newer Java version than I do, whose 
javadoc is stricter than Java 6'.

The first error should be fixed by replacing the "{@link 
fiji.util.Circle_Fitter}" with "Fiji_Plugin's Circle_Fitter class" 
(Fiji_Plugins is no longer a dependency, hence the javadoc for that 
class is not found, meaning that the link is invalid).

The second issue would be fixed by replacing "@param t      whether or 
not to include time in filename" by "@param xyztt      which axes to 
include in the filename" ? the "@param" construct tries to explain a 
parameter, and there is no "t", but a yet unexplained "xyztt" parameter, 
as you can see here: 
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/d0276596c91b5764b21b11146a60e248f5f74506/src/main/java/spim/progacq/IndividualImagesHandler.java#L13-L22

If that fixes things for you, it would be very nice if you could make a 
Pull Request as described here:

Johannes

Hi Rob,

It seems like you have two distinct problems.

The best place to ask this question is the OpenSPIM mailing list (Cc'd).

>From looking at the problem report that you sent separately, it appears
that the error is the result of not setting the OBIS device's Port when
adding it in the Hardware Configuration Wizard. You need to set Port to
the appropriate COM port.

I'm not sure how the OBIS USB interface works (and cannot easily check
online at the moment), but I think the OBIS controllers that work with
Micro-Manager either have a serial (RS-232) port, or their USB port
works as a virtual serial port (i.e. shows up as a COM port when plugged
in). If it is the latter, you should see a COM port that can be selected
for Port (and it should appear only when the controller is connected to
the computer, though you will need to restart Micro-Manager for changes
to be recognized).

Also note that the baudrate needs to be set to 115200, as noted on our
device page (https://micro-manager.org/wiki/CoherentOBIS).

Hope this helps.

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <CALKrRTFpJNe3pCYqY2110-eve0SsDoueAECR6chDeffGLtexFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to get the OpenSPIM plugin to work on your 64bit Fiji with MM
v18 but I come across this error.

" Your setup appears to be invalid. Please make sure that you have the
camera and the 4D stage setup. You may need to restart MM for the openspim
plugin to detect a correct setup."

I have added all the devices to the system and restarted MM but the same
result occurs. I can't seem to open the app open.

I am just wondering whether I have calibrated the system properly or is
there an underlying issue I haven't seen.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Rob

The javadoc and sources .jar files are unnecessary, but the location is 
important: mmplugins/ inside the ImageJ directory. That is where 
Micro-Manager looks.

Hi Ulrik,

did you have time to think about incorporating the HiRes stage? If not,  
I'd like to at least try tackle it myself, but I'll probably need a little  
help with that. So first question would be: are the links to the source  
code here the newest verion? :)

Unfortunately, it is outdated. I won't have time to fix the page anytime 
soon, therefore I would be very grateful if you would find the time to 
update it.

Our current plan is to move as much as possible of the OpenSPIM software 
to upstream ("upstream" means Micro-Manager proper).

Due to the use of the (stabilizing, but not quite stable yet) ImgLib2 
library, we cannot move the OpenSPIM plugin into Micro-Manager just yet.

Therefore, the OpenSPIM plugin is maintained here for the moment: 
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

I tried to be very clear in the instructions in the README.md how to 
build it; If you find that you can improve it, I would appreciate a Pull 
Request [*1*] very much!

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

what about the Picard stage driver for the Micro Manager? Doesn't it need  
to be changed as well?

The Picard stage driver in Micro-Manager is the only part of the 
OpenSPIM software we managed to contribute so far. Therefore: no, it 
does not need to be changed.

Starting Micro-Manager from the command-line, you should see something 
like this in the log:

```
[...]
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/RandomAccessibleInterval
[...]
```

This message indicates that ImgLib2 is missing from your installation. 
My idea was to start from a Fiji installation where the 
Micro-Manager-dev update site is activated. That way, ImgLib2 is already 
installed.

However, if you insist on using a Micro-Manager installed from the 
official Micro-Manager installers, you can add those dependencies 
manually, as follows:

1. Run `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` in the SPIMAcquisition 
directory
2. From `target/dependency/` in that subdirectory, copy the 
`imglib2-*.jar` files to your Micro-Manager's `mmplugins/` subdirectory.
3. Copy `target/SPIMAcquisition-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the `mmplugins/` 
subdirectory, too.
4. Restart Micro-Manager.

I also added these instructions to the `README.md` file of the 
SPIMAcquisition project.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

the reason I am asking about the Picard stage driver is the following:

the OpenSPIM plugin should make it possible to move the stage up to 9 mm.  
However, when I set the step size 0.25 um and max number of steps 45000 in  
the Hardware Configuration, I can only go up to 8191.75 um, or 32767  
steps. This happens both in the OpenSPIM plugin and when using the  
MicroManager "Stage control" plugin (see attachement). I use the mFiji  
version provided by Ulrik.

Using the software provided by Picard I can go up to 45000 steps.

Any ideas why this is so?

Best regards,

This looks like an arbitrary limit, however, I could only see an 
arbitrary limit of 8000 in the source code: 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/5f1c8d2079aa2d354820b82faae57e6ce53047d0/DeviceAdapters/PicardStage/PicardStage.cpp#L716

I have not the faintest idea from what source code Ulrik has built this 
version ? I am still waiting for his Pull Request(s)... ;-)

> Using the software provided by Picard I can go up to 45000 steps.
> 
> Any ideas why this is so?

As I said, I think there are some very arbitrary limits in the source 
code which should be turned into properties that can be set in the 
hardware configuration wizard (with sensible default values, of 
course!), also indicated by the `TODO` I linked above.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

thank you very much for your help and effort. Unfortunately your idea to 
copy the FIJI dependencies to Micro-Manager didn't work. I get the same 
inactive 'plugins' sub-menu as before.


I thought I have to start from Micro-Manager installers instead of 
starting in FIJI. Because trying to open Micro-Manager from FIJI gives 
me another error message:

'Failed to load the mmcorej_wrap native library 
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V'

Something with the 32/64bit java system, right? How can I solve it?

cheers
Carsten

If you start Micro-Manager from the command-line, you should see some 
output, most likely including an exception. This will be the tell-tale 
what is missing.

Since I tested the procedure on Linux and you are most likely on 
Windows, it is quite likely that there are differences in what you have 
to copy from the `target/dependency/` directory.

Plain Fiji does not have Micro-Manager; you will need to install it by 
following the Micro-Manager-dev update site (Help>Update..., then click 
on "Manage update sites", hit the "Add" button and fill in the first and 
second column of the added row with the values "Micro-Manager-dev" and 
"http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/" respectively; I wrote this 
from memory, some things might be named differently)

Hi,

I was wondering if anybody made some experience with stitching of OpenSPIM  
data? In the wiki only time lapses and angles are described, and I'm  
interested with stitching tiles at different XY positions. I made some  
attempts with the Grid/Collection stitching plugin of Fiji, but no success  
so far. Maybe my images are simply not good enough.

It would be cool to collect the experience about it and made a  
correspoding wiki page.

Dear Monika,

If you have enough overlap between the tiles and enough memory on your computer you can probably just do it with the SPIM registration plugins. Potentially, better with the new pipeline which is less well documented http://fiji.sc/Multiview-Reconstruction.

Otherwise, register the multi view in one vertical position, fuse. Then do the same in the other vertical position and try stitching this in Fiji (with the Grid/Collection stitching). We did that with LZ1 data, it should work with OpenSPIM too. Note that stitching only makes sense when your images are shifted/translated only. It will not work if they are rotated.

All the best

I think the best idea would be to ask your question on the ImageJ 
mailing list (imagej at list.nih.gov); There are many experts of Stitching 
over there...

Hi Johannes,

it still doesn't work properly, but I have th estrong feeling that we 
are almost there.

I didn't know that I explicitly need the 'Micro-Manager-dev' site for 
updating FIJI. Instead I chose 'OpenSPIM' which is pre-list on the 
update site. That also gave me a Micro-Manager menu in FIJI and the 
error message I previously mentioned. Maybe just an individual problem 
of my computer, but if this is a general problem with the OpenSPIM 
update site it is something to notice, right? Can someone else confirm 
of deny my findings?

So I updated FIJI via Micro-Manager-dev site and 'Acquire SPIM image' 
appeared in the Plugins menu of Micro-Manager. But by clicking on it no 
window opens. Strangely I can control the 4d stage via the mouse in the 
live window which means that at least that feature from SPIMAcquisition 
works, right? Any ideas or suggestions?

best,
Carsten

This update site contains an outdated version of Micro-Manager, not the 
latest. Since you want to develop the SPIMAcquisition plugin (which was 
updated to work with the newest Micro-Manager), you need to switch off 
the OpenSPIM update site for the moment.

I strongly suspect the command-line output to shed more light into the 
issue. As I said, I cannot run the SPIMAcquisition plugin on my 
computer, therefore I could not test what *other* dependencies (apart 
from the imglib2-* ones) need to be copied.

Ciao,
Johannes

Thanks, I didn't realize that stitching is possible with SPIM plugins as  
well.

It turns out that the problem was the ome.tiff format - Fiji was reading  
all the files and starting the calculation, but never getting the right  
result, after conversion to .tif my test images worked.

Monika

Hi Johannes,

to be honest I don't know exactely what command-line I should use to see 
what is missing. Google didn't help here. I also was playing around a 
lot but couldn't find something appropriate. I need your help again.

Thanks and best regards

I apologize in advance if the answer to my question is somewhere in the
archives.

I am interested in building a T-SPIM system and ran across an archived
conversation on this from June 2014. There was mention that such a setup
had been built as well as a possible 3D model of the imaging chamber being
available. I couldn't find any additional information on the OpenSPIM.org
site and just wanted to ask if there was a link to this information
somewhere. Based on the 3D model on the site it looks like you really just
need to replicate one arm of the laser path and add a 50/50 splitter near
the laser. Would there be needed changes to the operating software? If so,
that is beyond my (rather limited) capabilities. However, if instructions
exist that'd be great!

I appreciate any information you may have on this.

Best,
David

We are talking about starting Micro-Manager (not Fiji), right?

First, you have to find out where Micro-Manager was installed.

The easiest way to find out used to be to right-click on the 
Micro-Manager icon (either on the Desktop or in the Start Menu) and 
select "Properties". The window that pops up should show the working 
directory as well as the executable, but at least in my Windows version, 
it only says "(multiple values)" and tells me no more.

Absent that information, you need to either remember where you installed 
it, or find the installation location. In my setup, it is C:\Program 
Files\Micro-Manager-1.4 (the default).

Next, you need to edit the `ImageJ.cfg` file in that directory (it might 
be generated only after you started Micro-Manager for the first time). 
In the second line, it says something about a "javaw.exe". To see the 
command-line output, you will have to change that to "java.exe" (i.e. 
remove the "w"), for example by directing your Windows Explorer to the 
Micro-Manager directory, right-clicking on the `ImageJ.cfg` icon, 
selecting "Open With" from the context menu and opting to edit with 
Notepad.

After that, start Micro-Manager and you will see a command-line window 
pop up that gives you a metric ton of information. Typically, you will 
want to extend the buffer by right-clicking on the window icon on the 
left of the window's title bar, open the Properties from the context 
menu, and increase the "Buffer Size" in the "Command History" group of 
the "Options" tab from its ridiculous "50" to something more appropriate 
(I chose 5000 here). That will allow you to scroll back and read 
information that whizzed by too fast.

If you were talking about Fiji instead, have a look here to find out how 
to run from the command-line: http://fiji.sc/Command-Line_Debugging.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hey David,

Pete might have a step file for the 3-objective chamber. And yes, in principle you just need two arms and a 50/50 splitter, but there are some limitations. Unless you add shutters or AOTFs, you simultaneously illuminate from both sides. Depending on the sample, this might not be ideal, as you get an overlay of "sharp" and "blurry" images. This typically gets worse with larger samples. You can add manual shutters to be able to choose the side of illumination. If you want to be able to quickly record images with sequential double-sided illumination, you need to integrate shutters/AOTFs into the software.

Best,
Michael

Thanks, Michael.

Depending on the sample, this might not be ideal, as you get an overlay of
> "sharp" and "blurry" images.

Is this due to the fact that one light sheet, say from the left, may not
have its minimum beam waist at the same position as that from that of the
right sheet? Or more due to scattering, absorption, etc. of the light as it
interacts with the specimen?
I found some images that showed what you are talking about. I just thought
there may be some 'middle ground' you could settle on by adjusting the
sheets from either side that would give relatively uniform illumination
(but with a loss of resolution).
It does sound like - if you choose the slow manual method - this could be
doable. Illuminate from left > capture images > close left shutter >
illuminate from right > capture > merge?
Perhaps detailed designs of a T-SPIM system will eventually be uploaded to
the web along with the modifications to the software to drive the
additional hardware.

Have a great weekend,
David

Hi David,

At the moment I run an OpenSPIM in a L-mode but I want it upgrade it to 
a T-SPIM. Therefore I integrated already the sample chamber for dual 
side illumination.  Once I'll have the money for the parts of the second 
illumination path and a shutter system I'll go for it.
I uploaded a photo of the chamber that you get an impression 
(http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F). Pete Pitrone designed this 
master piece and, as Michael already said, he might have it as 3D vector 
graphic file.

Best,
Carsten

David,

Pieter Fourie, the machinist that is linked to on the part list for the openspim has made the T-SPIM sample chamber (http://www.pfde.co.uk/wgallerydisplay.php?album_id=242569&photo_id=360213).  He has been great to work with on the L-configuration and does great work with very reasonable pricing.  To the point that I couldn't find any one locally (Indiana US) that could come close at cost and of course experience.  Might be worth contacting him too.  

Seth

Hi David,

you are right, with "blurry" I was referring to those parts of an image that are illuminated with a scattered/absorbed/refracted light sheet. You can of course adjust your system in several ways, either by making the light sheets more homogeneous and using simultaneous illumination, or by placing the waists of two thin "left" and "right" light sheets next to each other and using sequential acquisitions. Something to keep in mind is that sequential acquisitions take at least twice as long, require twice as much space and you have to merge both sides in a post-processing step. My recommendation is, as you already suggested, to start with a simple system with a 50/50 splitter and manual shutters.

Best,
Michael

Hi Johannes,

thank you very much for your detailed informations. I did as you 
suggested and I start with no additional dependancies.

First I got a lot of infomration including this exception:

net/imglib2/algorithm/MultiThreaded

I copied the 'imglib2-algorithm-0.1.1' jar file into the mmplugins 
folder. From the name it was the closest.

Then I got this exception:

  [IFO,App] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/Interval

I copied the 'imglib2-2.2.0' jar file into the mmplugins folder.


Then I got this exception:

[IFO,App] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/labeling/Labeling

Now I don't know what to do furhter. I was looking up for 
'imglib2/labeling' and it seems that this is part of the imglib2 that I 
copied already. So something is not proper with my dependancies from 
FIJI? I slightly start to understand more and more (probably the very 
tip of the iceberg) but again I need help.

thanks in advance
Carsten

Hi Carsten,

After running the command `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`, the 
`target/dependency/` directory will contain all dependencies that were 
required to compile the SPIMAcquisition plugin. It is safe to assume 
that all of them are required by the plugin to work in its entirety. The 
only reason not to copy them all wholesale into the `mmplugins/` 
directory is that some of the dependencies are available in 
Micro-Manager already, in different versions.

If you want to go the hard route, it might be wiser not to start without 
additional dependencies and copying one by one based on exceptions 
printed in the console output, but instead to determine for every single 
.jar file in `target/dependency/` whether it needs to be copied. If 
there is already a version in the Micro-Manager directory (or its 
subdirectories), it does not need to be copied -- indeed, it might make 
functions fail if you do so. As an example, the ij-1.*.jar file does not 
need to be copied because there is already an ij.jar file in 
Micro-Manager's top-level directory. Likewise, the commons-math and 
commons-math3 .jar files are already present in plugins/Micro-Manager/.

In general, it might have made more sense to start with a Fiji 
installation, follow the Micro-Manager-dev update site and copy the 
SPIMAcquisition .jar file, as I had suggested originally.

Ciao,
Johannes

Dear Micro-Manager Users,

As we previously announced, later this year we are going to move the
core development of Micro-Manager from UCSF to a small company that we
will be founding soon, in order to ensure the long-term continuation and
success of Micro-Manager. You can read our previous announcement here:
http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/The-future-of-Micro-Manager-tp7584449.html

We are going to keep Micro-Manager free and open source, and plan to
support its development mainly through paid user support. Your
subscription to the support service will help ensure that Micro-Manager
remains a relevant and useful program and continues to improve.

Please take a moment to preview our preliminary support programs 
(subject to
change) here:
http://bit.ly/1vk83Ff

We want to ensure that these programs are truly useful to you, and would
like to get your feedback on how they are structured. Toward that end, 
we
would very much appreciate your participation in a short survey about 
these
programs and other aspects of the future of Micro-Manager.

Here is the link to the survey:

                        http://bit.ly/17gD1Jf


Thank you very much for spending a moment of your time on this!
Please also feel free to contact us directly with feedback at
info at micro-manager.org.

Please also forward this email to anybody you know who is a
Micro-Manager user but is not subscribed to this mailing list.

Hi Johannes,

I agree, of course it makes more sense to start with FIJI but as I wrote 
earlier also here I have problems. Without debug mode this was a fatal 
error and Micro-Manager closed. This let me think it would be easier to 
'go back' to the Micro-Manager version.

Now, running FIJI in debug mode I get following suspicious lines (I 
excluded all others):

1 First when I start FIJI:
...
[IFO,App] Installing plugin org.micromanager.browser.Data_Browser...
[IFO,App] Error: Plugin [org.micromanager.browser.Data_Browser] has no 
menuName field

[IFO,App] Error: Plugin [org.micromanager.DLLAutoReloader] has no 
menuName field
[IFO,App] org.micromanager.DLLAutoReloader fails to implement static 
String tooltipDescription.

2 No error line when I start Mikro-Manager.

3 When I start 'Acquire SPIM image' I get following exception message:

Message-ID: <0BB84AC4E46D2D4AB1AE4C111324E8D63DBAB5A5@IU-MSSG-MBX107.ads.iu.edu>

Johannes and list,

I've made pretty good progress on the hardware implementation of multiple channels for our L-SPIM.  On the software side I've adapted drivers and firmware to control my homebuilt DAC (6ch for now) and NEOS-AOTF setup in micromanager and pulled everything into the SPIMAcquisition plugin with the Device abstraction, a new DAC class and DAC voltage GUI.  Eventually there will be a wattage calibration.  I also have a Sutter 10-2 implemented in the SPIMAcquisition plugin via Device and a FilterWheel class.  Right now these new devices can be accessed and controlled through SPIMsetup.  I do need to push all these changes to a new branch... getting there.

I'm now thinking through the acquisition side of things and before I get to far down a particular path I wanted to see if there were any strong opinions about the implementation of multiple channels.  I believe I understand how you've implemented acquisition and haven't found a simple way to add the extra dimension of channels (DAC and filter wheel).  This could be because I'm missing something in the implementation though.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

Thank you for the update. I am on a trip right now, therefore I lack the 
time to comment appropriately; Please bear with me, I will answer this 
coming week.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] SPIMAcquisition plugin installation fails
Message-ID: <54D8D259.8060109@rz.hu-berlin.de>

Hi everybody,

I have a problem installing the SPIM acquisition plugin as decribed in 
'https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition' and I need help to 
interpret the error messages. I am not experienced and just started with 
doing such things like building plugins from a local repository. So far 
not really successful...

As described on github I used Maven for a local repository. The error 
comes with the last builing command '|mvn -Dscijava.enforce.skip'; not 
immediately but just after 8 minutes.

here the error message:

It looks like you are using a newer Java version than I do, whose 
javadoc is stricter than Java 6'.

The first error should be fixed by replacing the "{@link 
fiji.util.Circle_Fitter}" with "Fiji_Plugin's Circle_Fitter class" 
(Fiji_Plugins is no longer a dependency, hence the javadoc for that 
class is not found, meaning that the link is invalid).

The second issue would be fixed by replacing "@param t      whether or 
not to include time in filename" by "@param xyztt      which axes to 
include in the filename" – the "@param" construct tries to explain a 
parameter, and there is no "t", but a yet unexplained "xyztt" parameter, 
as you can see here: 
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/d0276596c91b5764b21b11146a60e248f5f74506/src/main/java/spim/progacq/IndividualImagesHandler.java#L13-L22

If that fixes things for you, it would be very nice if you could make a 
Pull Request as described here:

Johannes

Hi Rob,

It seems like you have two distinct problems.

The best place to ask this question is the OpenSPIM mailing list (Cc'd).

>From looking at the problem report that you sent separately, it appears
that the error is the result of not setting the OBIS device's Port when
adding it in the Hardware Configuration Wizard. You need to set Port to
the appropriate COM port.

I'm not sure how the OBIS USB interface works (and cannot easily check
online at the moment), but I think the OBIS controllers that work with
Micro-Manager either have a serial (RS-232) port, or their USB port
works as a virtual serial port (i.e. shows up as a COM port when plugged
in). If it is the latter, you should see a COM port that can be selected
for Port (and it should appear only when the controller is connected to
the computer, though you will need to restart Micro-Manager for changes
to be recognized).

Also note that the baudrate needs to be set to 115200, as noted on our
device page (https://micro-manager.org/wiki/CoherentOBIS).

Hope this helps.

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <CALKrRTFpJNe3pCYqY2110-eve0SsDoueAECR6chDeffGLtexFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to get the OpenSPIM plugin to work on your 64bit Fiji with MM
v18 but I come across this error.

" Your setup appears to be invalid. Please make sure that you have the
camera and the 4D stage setup. You may need to restart MM for the openspim
plugin to detect a correct setup."

I have added all the devices to the system and restarted MM but the same
result occurs. I can't seem to open the app open.

I am just wondering whether I have calibrated the system properly or is
there an underlying issue I haven't seen.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Rob

The javadoc and sources .jar files are unnecessary, but the location is 
important: mmplugins/ inside the ImageJ directory. That is where 
Micro-Manager looks.

Hi Ulrik,

did you have time to think about incorporating the HiRes stage? If not,  
I'd like to at least try tackle it myself, but I'll probably need a little  
help with that. So first question would be: are the links to the source

Unfortunately, it is outdated. I won't have time to fix the page anytime 
soon, therefore I would be very grateful if you would find the time to 
update it.

Our current plan is to move as much as possible of the OpenSPIM software 
to upstream ("upstream" means Micro-Manager proper).

Due to the use of the (stabilizing, but not quite stable yet) ImgLib2 
library, we cannot move the OpenSPIM plugin into Micro-Manager just yet.

Therefore, the OpenSPIM plugin is maintained here for the moment: 
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

I tried to be very clear in the instructions in the README.md how to 
build it; If you find that you can improve it, I would appreciate a Pull 
Request [*1*] very much!

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

what about the Picard stage driver for the Micro Manager? Doesn't it need  
to be changed as well?

The Picard stage driver in Micro-Manager is the only part of the 
OpenSPIM software we managed to contribute so far. Therefore: no, it 
does not need to be changed.

Starting Micro-Manager from the command-line, you should see something 
like this in the log:

```
[...]
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/RandomAccessibleInterval
[...]
```

This message indicates that ImgLib2 is missing from your installation. 
My idea was to start from a Fiji installation where the 
Micro-Manager-dev update site is activated. That way, ImgLib2 is already 
installed.

However, if you insist on using a Micro-Manager installed from the 
official Micro-Manager installers, you can add those dependencies 
manually, as follows:

1. Run `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` in the SPIMAcquisition 
directory
2. From `target/dependency/` in that subdirectory, copy the 
`imglib2-*.jar` files to your Micro-Manager's `mmplugins/` subdirectory.
3. Copy `target/SPIMAcquisition-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the `mmplugins/` 
subdirectory, too.
4. Restart Micro-Manager.

I also added these instructions to the `README.md` file of the 
SPIMAcquisition project.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

the reason I am asking about the Picard stage driver is the following:

the OpenSPIM plugin should make it possible to move the stage up to 9 mm.  
However, when I set the step size 0.25 um and max number of steps 45000 in  
the Hardware Configuration, I can only go up to 8191.75 um, or 32767  
steps. This happens both in the OpenSPIM plugin and when using the  
MicroManager "Stage control" plugin (see attachement). I use the mFiji  
version provided by Ulrik.

Using the software provided by Picard I can go up to 45000 steps.

Any ideas why this is so?

Best regards,

This looks like an arbitrary limit, however, I could only see an 
arbitrary limit of 8000 in the source code: 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/5f1c8d2079aa2d354820b82faae57e6ce53047d0/DeviceAdapters/PicardStage/PicardStage.cpp#L716

I have not the faintest idea from what source code Ulrik has built this 
version – I am still waiting for his Pull Request(s)... ;-)

> Using the software provided by Picard I can go up to 45000 steps.
> 
> Any ideas why this is so?

As I said, I think there are some very arbitrary limits in the source 
code which should be turned into properties that can be set in the 
hardware configuration wizard (with sensible default values, of 
course!), also indicated by the `TODO` I linked above.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

thank you very much for your help and effort. Unfortunately your idea to 
copy the FIJI dependencies to Micro-Manager didn't work. I get the same 
inactive 'plugins' sub-menu as before.


I thought I have to start from Micro-Manager installers instead of 
starting in FIJI. Because trying to open Micro-Manager from FIJI gives 
me another error message:

'Failed to load the mmcorej_wrap native library 
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V'

Something with the 32/64bit java system, right? How can I solve it?

cheers
Carsten

If you start Micro-Manager from the command-line, you should see some 
output, most likely including an exception. This will be the tell-tale 
what is missing.

Since I tested the procedure on Linux and you are most likely on 
Windows, it is quite likely that there are differences in what you have 
to copy from the `target/dependency/` directory.

Plain Fiji does not have Micro-Manager; you will need to install it by 
following the Micro-Manager-dev update site (Help>Update..., then click 
on "Manage update sites", hit the "Add" button and fill in the first and 
second column of the added row with the values "Micro-Manager-dev" and 
"http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/" respectively; I wrote this 
from memory, some things might be named differently)

Johannes

Hi,

I was wondering if anybody made some experience with stitching of OpenSPIM  
data? In the wiki only time lapses and angles are described, and I'm  
interested with stitching tiles at different XY positions. I made some  
attempts with the Grid/Collection stitching plugin of Fiji, but no success  
so far. Maybe my images are simply not good enough.

It would be cool to collect the experience about it and made a  
correspoding wiki page.

Dear Monika,

If you have enough overlap between the tiles and enough memory on your computer you can probably just do it with the SPIM registration plugins. Potentially, better with the new pipeline which is less well documented http://fiji.sc/Multiview-Reconstruction.

Otherwise, register the multi view in one vertical position, fuse. Then do the same in the other vertical position and try stitching this in Fiji (with the Grid/Collection stitching). We did that with LZ1 data, it should work with OpenSPIM too. Note that stitching only makes sense when your images are shifted/translated only. It will not work if they are rotated.

All the best

I think the best idea would be to ask your question on the ImageJ 
mailing list (imagej at list.nih.gov); There are many experts of Stitching 
over there...

Hi Johannes,

it still doesn't work properly, but I have th estrong feeling that we 
are almost there.

I didn't know that I explicitly need the 'Micro-Manager-dev' site for 
updating FIJI. Instead I chose 'OpenSPIM' which is pre-list on the 
update site. That also gave me a Micro-Manager menu in FIJI and the 
error message I previously mentioned. Maybe just an individual problem 
of my computer, but if this is a general problem with the OpenSPIM 
update site it is something to notice, right? Can someone else confirm 
of deny my findings?

So I updated FIJI via Micro-Manager-dev site and 'Acquire SPIM image' 
appeared in the Plugins menu of Micro-Manager. But by clicking on it no 
window opens. Strangely I can control the 4d stage via the mouse in the 
live window which means that at least that feature from SPIMAcquisition 
works, right? Any ideas or suggestions?

best,
Carsten

This update site contains an outdated version of Micro-Manager, not the 
latest. Since you want to develop the SPIMAcquisition plugin (which was 
updated to work with the newest Micro-Manager), you need to switch off 
the OpenSPIM update site for the moment.

I strongly suspect the command-line output to shed more light into the 
issue. As I said, I cannot run the SPIMAcquisition plugin on my 
computer, therefore I could not test what *other* dependencies (apart 
from the imglib2-* ones) need to be copied.

Thanks, I didn't realize that stitching is possible with SPIM plugins as  
well.

It turns out that the problem was the ome.tiff format - Fiji was reading  
all the files and starting the calculation, but never getting the right  
result, after conversion to .tif my test images worked.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Johannes,

to be honest I don't know exactely what command-line I should use to see 
what is missing. Google didn't help here. I also was playing around a 
lot but couldn't find something appropriate. I need your help again.

Thanks and best regards

I apologize in advance if the answer to my question is somewhere in the
archives.

I am interested in building a T-SPIM system and ran across an archived
conversation on this from June 2014. There was mention that such a setup
had been built as well as a possible 3D model of the imaging chamber being
available. I couldn't find any additional information on the OpenSPIM.org
site and just wanted to ask if there was a link to this information
somewhere. Based on the 3D model on the site it looks like you really just
need to replicate one arm of the laser path and add a 50/50 splitter near
the laser. Would there be needed changes to the operating software? If so,
that is beyond my (rather limited) capabilities. However, if instructions
exist that'd be great!

I appreciate any information you may have on this.

Best,
David

We are talking about starting Micro-Manager (not Fiji), right?

First, you have to find out where Micro-Manager was installed.

The easiest way to find out used to be to right-click on the 
Micro-Manager icon (either on the Desktop or in the Start Menu) and 
select "Properties". The window that pops up should show the working 
directory as well as the executable, but at least in my Windows version, 
it only says "(multiple values)" and tells me no more.

Absent that information, you need to either remember where you installed 
it, or find the installation location. In my setup, it is C:\Program 
Files\Micro-Manager-1.4 (the default).

Next, you need to edit the `ImageJ.cfg` file in that directory (it might 
be generated only after you started Micro-Manager for the first time). 
In the second line, it says something about a "javaw.exe". To see the 
command-line output, you will have to change that to "java.exe" (i.e. 
remove the "w"), for example by directing your Windows Explorer to the 
Micro-Manager directory, right-clicking on the `ImageJ.cfg` icon, 
selecting "Open With" from the context menu and opting to edit with 
Notepad.

After that, start Micro-Manager and you will see a command-line window 
pop up that gives you a metric ton of information. Typically, you will 
want to extend the buffer by right-clicking on the window icon on the 
left of the window's title bar, open the Properties from the context 
menu, and increase the "Buffer Size" in the "Command History" group of 
the "Options" tab from its ridiculous "50" to something more appropriate 
(I chose 5000 here). That will allow you to scroll back and read 
information that whizzed by too fast.

If you were talking about Fiji instead, have a look here to find out how 
to run from the command-line: http://fiji.sc/Command-Line_Debugging.

Johannes

Hey David,

Pete might have a step file for the 3-objective chamber. And yes, in principle you just need two arms and a 50/50 splitter, but there are some limitations. Unless you add shutters or AOTFs, you simultaneously illuminate from both sides. Depending on the sample, this might not be ideal, as you get an overlay of "sharp" and "blurry" images. This typically gets worse with larger samples. You can add manual shutters to be able to choose the side of illumination. If you want to be able to quickly record images with sequential double-sided illumination, you need to integrate shutters/AOTFs into the software.

Best,
Michael

Thanks, Michael.

Depending on the sample, this might not be ideal, as you get an overlay of
> "sharp" and "blurry" images.

Is this due to the fact that one light sheet, say from the left, may not
have its minimum beam waist at the same position as that from that of the
right sheet? Or more due to scattering, absorption, etc. of the light as it
interacts with the specimen?
I found some images that showed what you are talking about. I just thought
there may be some 'middle ground' you could settle on by adjusting the
sheets from either side that would give relatively uniform illumination
(but with a loss of resolution).
It does sound like - if you choose the slow manual method - this could be
doable. Illuminate from left > capture images > close left shutter >
illuminate from right > capture > merge?
Perhaps detailed designs of a T-SPIM system will eventually be uploaded to
the web along with the modifications to the software to drive the
additional hardware.

Have a great weekend,
David

Hi David,

At the moment I run an OpenSPIM in a L-mode but I want it upgrade it to 
a T-SPIM. Therefore I integrated already the sample chamber for dual 
side illumination.  Once I'll have the money for the parts of the second 
illumination path and a shutter system I'll go for it.
I uploaded a photo of the chamber that you get an impression 
(http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F). Pete Pitrone designed this 
master piece and, as Michael already said, he might have it as 3D vector 
graphic file.

Best,
Carsten

David,

Pieter Fourie, the machinist that is linked to on the part list for the openspim has made the T-SPIM sample chamber (http://www.pfde.co.uk/wgallerydisplay.php?album_id=242569&photo_id=360213).  He has been great to work with on the L-configuration and does great work with very reasonable pricing.  To the point that I couldn't find any one locally (Indiana US) that could come close at cost and of course experience.  Might be worth contacting him too.  

Seth

Hi David,

you are right, with "blurry" I was referring to those parts of an image that are illuminated with a scattered/absorbed/refracted light sheet. You can of course adjust your system in several ways, either by making the light sheets more homogeneous and using simultaneous illumination, or by placing the waists of two thin "left" and "right" light sheets next to each other and using sequential acquisitions. Something to keep in mind is that sequential acquisitions take at least twice as long, require twice as much space and you have to merge both sides in a post-processing step. My recommendation is, as you already suggested, to start with a simple system with a 50/50 splitter and manual shutters.

Best,
Michael

Hi Johannes,

thank you very much for your detailed informations. I did as you 
suggested and I start with no additional dependancies.

First I got a lot of infomration including this exception:

  [IFO,App] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
net/imglib2/algorithm/MultiThreaded

I copied the 'imglib2-algorithm-0.1.1' jar file into the mmplugins 
folder. From the name it was the closest.

Then I got this exception:

  [IFO,App] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/Interval

I copied the 'imglib2-2.2.0' jar file into the mmplugins folder.


Then I got this exception:

[IFO,App] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/imglib2/labeling/Labeling

Now I don't know what to do furhter. I was looking up for 
'imglib2/labeling' and it seems that this is part of the imglib2 that I 
copied already. So something is not proper with my dependancies from 
FIJI? I slightly start to understand more and more (probably the very 
tip of the iceberg) but again I need help.

thanks in advance
Carsten

After running the command `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`, the 
`target/dependency/` directory will contain all dependencies that were 
required to compile the SPIMAcquisition plugin. It is safe to assume 
that all of them are required by the plugin to work in its entirety. The 
only reason not to copy them all wholesale into the `mmplugins/` 
directory is that some of the dependencies are available in 
Micro-Manager already, in different versions.

If you want to go the hard route, it might be wiser not to start without 
additional dependencies and copying one by one based on exceptions 
printed in the console output, but instead to determine for every single 
.jar file in `target/dependency/` whether it needs to be copied. If 
there is already a version in the Micro-Manager directory (or its 
subdirectories), it does not need to be copied -- indeed, it might make 
functions fail if you do so. As an example, the ij-1.*.jar file does not 
need to be copied because there is already an ij.jar file in 
Micro-Manager's top-level directory. Likewise, the commons-math and 
commons-math3 .jar files are already present in plugins/Micro-Manager/.

In general, it might have made more sense to start with a Fiji 
installation, follow the Micro-Manager-dev update site and copy the 
SPIMAcquisition .jar file, as I had suggested originally.

Ciao,
Johannes

Dear Micro-Manager Users,

As we previously announced, later this year we are going to move the
core development of Micro-Manager from UCSF to a small company that we
will be founding soon, in order to ensure the long-term continuation and
success of Micro-Manager. You can read our previous announcement here:
http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/The-future-of-Micro-Manager-tp7584449.html

We are going to keep Micro-Manager free and open source, and plan to
support its development mainly through paid user support. Your
subscription to the support service will help ensure that Micro-Manager
remains a relevant and useful program and continues to improve.

Please take a moment to preview our preliminary support programs 
(subject to
change) here:
http://bit.ly/1vk83Ff

We want to ensure that these programs are truly useful to you, and would
like to get your feedback on how they are structured. Toward that end, 
we
would very much appreciate your participation in a short survey about 
these
programs and other aspects of the future of Micro-Manager.

Here is the link to the survey:

                        http://bit.ly/17gD1Jf


Thank you very much for spending a moment of your time on this!
Please also feel free to contact us directly with feedback at
info at micro-manager.org.

Please also forward this email to anybody you know who is a
Micro-Manager user but is not subscribed to this mailing list.

Hi Johannes,

I agree, of course it makes more sense to start with FIJI but as I wrote 
earlier also here I have problems. Without debug mode this was a fatal 
error and Micro-Manager closed. This let me think it would be easier to 
'go back' to the Micro-Manager version.

Now, running FIJI in debug mode I get following suspicious lines (I 
excluded all others):

1 First when I start FIJI:
...
[IFO,App] Installing plugin org.micromanager.browser.Data_Browser...
[IFO,App] Error: Plugin [org.micromanager.browser.Data_Browser] has no 
menuName field
[IFO,App] org.micromanager.browser.Data_Browser fails to implement

...

[IFO,App] Error: Plugin [org.micromanager.SlideExplorer2] has no 
menuName field
[IFO,App] org.micromanager.SlideExplorer2 fails to implement static

...

[IFO,App] Error: Plugin [org.micromanager.DLLAutoReloader] has no 
menuName field
[IFO,App] org.micromanager.DLLAutoReloader fails to implement static 
String tooltipDescription.

2 No error line when I start Mikro-Manager.

3 When I start 'Acquire SPIM image' I get following exception message:

Subject: [OpenSPIM] MultiChannel Acquisition Implementation

Johannes and list,

I've made pretty good progress on the hardware implementation of multiple channels for our L-SPIM.  On the software side I've adapted drivers and firmware to control my homebuilt DAC (6ch for now) and NEOS-AOTF setup in micromanager and pulled everything into the SPIMAcquisition plugin with the Device abstraction, a new DAC class and DAC voltage GUI.  Eventually there will be a wattage calibration.  I also have a Sutter 10-2 implemented in the SPIMAcquisition plugin via Device and a FilterWheel class.  Right now these new devices can be accessed and controlled through SPIMsetup.  I do need to push all these changes to a new branch... getting there.

I'm now thinking through the acquisition side of things and before I get to far down a particular path I wanted to see if there were any strong opinions about the implementation of multiple channels.  I believe I understand how you've implemented acquisition and haven't found a simple way to add the extra dimension of channels (DAC and filter wheel).  This could be because I'm missing something in the implementation though.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

Seth

Thank you for the update. I am on a trip right now, therefore I lack the 
time to comment appropriately; Please bear with me, I will answer this 
coming week.

Ciao,
Johannes
