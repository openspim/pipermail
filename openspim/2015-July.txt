Hi Marco,

That's great - I would love to hear about how CyGel works for you for
OpenSPIM/lightsheet - and I'm very curious about the two-component hydrogel
for live samples that does not require a temperature trigger.  It would be
great to hear about it on OpenSPIM if and when you can share details :)

Good luck!
Eric

Hi guys,

Thanks for the replies.

I will order the cygel and could let you know how I get on.
I had some inconclusive experiences with matrigel in the past too and would definitely be extremely interested by a gel that would polymerise by another route than temperature change.

Have a nice evening.

Best regards,
Arnaud Monnard.

Hi Arnaud,

I've never used it with OpenSPIM, or on a lightsheet system having a similar design for mounting, but CyGel or CyGel Sustain from BioStatus might work.  It offers improved optical clarity over agarose.  Also, it is a liquid at cold and becomes a solid at room temperature or higher, making it easy to recover live samples.  Its main drawback is cost but otherwise I really liked it when I tried it on a confocal and on a lattice lightsheet with live squid embryos and hatchlings.

I'd be curious to know how it goes, if you or others give it a try - or have tried it.

Subject: [micro-manager-general] Announcement: Micro-Manager 2.0 Alpha
Date: 2015-07-07 21:06
 From: Chris Weisiger <cweisiger at msg.ucsf.edu>
To: Micro-Manager General <micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net>
Reply-To: Micro-Manager General 
<micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net>

Folks, I'm pleased to announce that the first alpha build of 
Micro-Manager
2.0 is now available. Version 2.0 will be a major overhaul of
Micro-Manager's user interface (UI) and of the way the Java layer 
organizes
image data. It's designed to be easier to use than 1.4 (i.e. the current
official releases), while remaining backwards compatible with it. We'd
appreciate your assistance in testing it; while we've done a heck of a 
lot
of testing already, there's always the potential for bugs to sneak in
unnoticed.

Support for Micro-Manager 1.4 is going to continue for the foreseeable
future; we aren't going to shift all of our development focus to 2.0 
until
it's ready. Still, we believe that 2.0 is a major improvement over 1.4.
We've worked really hard to make this version of Micro-Manager the best 
it
can be. Examples of some of the many new features in the UI include:

  * An overhauled image display window with controls readily at hand
  * "Inspector" windows for easy access to histograms, metadata, and 
more,
allowing for side-by-side comparisons of multiple datasets
  * The ability to synchronize aspects of the display across multiple
windows, so windows can share histogram scalings, always show the same Z
slice, etc.
  * A user profile system so each user of the program can have their own
saved settings
  * Timestamp and scale bar overlays
  * A much better "day/night" system for more pleasant use in darkrooms

Here's a screenshot of the new UI:
http://i.imgur.com/PSqB8jJ.jpg

Additionally, the Java API has been vastly expanded and simplified (the
Core API is untouched). If you're a developer who works with 
Micro-Manager,
you should appreciate easy access to image data and metadata, control 
and
customization of image display windows, access to events, and more. On 
the
flip side, many old methods in the API are unfortunately no longer
available, so your plugins that depend on those methods will need to be
updated. We hope to keep this version of the API stable for many years 
to
come. For more information on the API, please see our wiki 
documentation:
https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Version_2.0

NOTE: as this is an alpha build, we cannot promise that it is "safe". It
does not modify the hardware control systems or the MDA, but data files 
it
generates will differ from data files generated in 1.4, if only in the
metadata. While I would love for people to try acquiring data with 2.0, 
I
can't recommend that you do serious, high-stakes science with it just 
yet.
Additionally, while 2.0 can read data files generated with 1.4, the 
reverse
may not be the case. Be careful about mixing files from 1.4 and 2.0.

You can download the most recent version of the alpha build from here:
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-alpha/Mac/
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-alpha/Windows/

If you find bugs, please let us know! If you have comments or feedback,
please let us know! If you have questions or requests, please let us 
know!
You can email the main mailing list (
micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net) or our internal email 
address (
info at micro-manager.org) for more private reports. Either way, please put
"[2.0]" in the email subject line so we can easily recognize that your
email relates to the alpha.

Additionally, we are moving our development towards using GitHub. Our
GitHub account is here:
https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager

You can file bug reports via the "Issues" link in the top-right. If you
want to download the source code for 2.0, use the "mm2" branch, not the
"master" branch.

Thank you for your time, and thanks for using Micro-Manager!

Message-ID: <tencent_4ABEA4450697CC43251C5CFC@qq.com>

Dear all,
   Today, I just did the initial hardware configuration, but there was something worng with the laser configuration. 
   The laser I used is LuxX? 488-60 Omicron and is connected to PC with USB line, and the laser can be controlled by the software provided by the manufacturer. When I add the laser in the hardware configuration wizard, it present a window but nothing in the list of the RS232 settings(the below pictrue, I don't know whether the pictrue can be show). And I try to click the "Scan" button, then alert a window tells that the port should be choosen manually. Also, when click the "OK" button, a window show and alert that "Serial command failed. Is the device connected to the serial port?". Therefore, the laser can not be added.
   Is there anyone else meet the trouble?  I hope for your help. Thank you!
   Best wishes!

Dear Zheng,

The chances are that you need to input the info yourself. Although we dod not have a Omicron laser, my gut feeling is that it is very similar to the Coherent lasers (CUBE and Obis) in that it uses a a 19,200 baud rate on a COM-port. I've never successfully used the "scan" button while creating a harware configuration.

Maybe there are other out there that can help you out more.

Regards,
Pete

Hi all, I hope the science treats you well.

I was wondering if anybody has a list of publications (and/or websites)
using the OpenSPIM or similar setup.  I'm pleased to say that I've
started to order parts for our build and I was curious to see more of
the data sets taken with this kind of setup.  I'm presenting to my
department in the week and need some representative data sets and
experiments.

I know of the PLOS paper from last year that investigates Ca sensing in
plant roots, but can't seem to find anything else.

I hope there are plenty more in the pipeline given that there are more
OpenSPIM setups out there.  I see 8 on the website, but are there more?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

I started a page on the OpenSPIM wiki:

     http://openspim.org/Publications

However, I feel a wiki should be edited by more than one person, so I 
did not do all that much on that page myself, still waiting for others 
to simply go and add their papers or papers related to OpenSPIM that 
they know about.

To answer your question, I turned to Google Scholar 
(https://scholar.google.com/) and searched for the term "OpenSPIM". 
Among the many reviews, there seem to be a couple of interesting "real" 
biology papers, e.g.:

     
http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=2241619

     http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/inversion.pdf

According to Picard systems (I asked a while ago), they have delivered 
at least 45 stages, so that is my conservative guess. Of course it would 
be nice to hear back from more people, given that our main aim was to 
start a collaborative community when we invested that insane amount of 
time and effort to make all of this IKEA grade instructions and a wiki 
and a mailing list.

So here is drinking to a vibrant community in the future!

Of the three systems I know personally, including my own: one will likely
be used as a tech testbed, one has just started gathering data or will
start very soon and I have just started putting screws to the breadboard
on mine.  Between backordered parts and troubleshooting it should take
about a month (optimistically) for ours to start gathering data.

If my small circle is representative I predict a very steep increase in
publications in the next year or so.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] opening SPIM data with Bio-formats plugin
Message-ID: <3ae2f566cfac7070863073cc2583bfa1@nencki.gov.pl>

Hi,

recently some people were writing about some issues when opening 
acquired images with Bio-formats. It seems that the super-slowness was 
at leats partly the fault of the Bio-formats: at least in my case, after 
the recent Fiji update that included Bio-formats 5.1.3, speed improved.

There is another issue though. When I open data that consists of several 
files, the Bio-formats plugin asks me which sries to open, but no matter 
what I choose, ALL the open files have the same header: 
spim_TL01_Angle0.ome . Always Angle0. This makes opening all files and 
doing something with them impossible because the info which is which is 
lost. Also, in the metadata there is a line: " Series 2 Name	null" or 
similar. When collecting images directly with micromanager, this line 
looks more like " Series 0 Name	XYseries_1_MMStack_Pos1" and then the 
open windows have collect headers. So the metadata is not saved 
correctly.

If somebody knows how to fix quickly, I'll be grateful for a hint, 
otherwise I'll try myself.

Regards,
Monika

Hi All,

Hi Developers,

We plan to release Micro-Manager 1.4.22 on Friday, August 14 (slightly
later than our regular schedule).

In all likelyhood, this will be the last official release version from
the UCSF Micro-Manager Team. Starting in October, Open Imaging will be
providing annual releases as free downloads (see [1]). We'll continue
to publish nightly builds until Sept 30.

If you have SVN write access and are working on untested changes, it
will be a good idea to avoid committing them to SVN during the week
before the release. If you need to commit a last-minute fix on the day
of the release, please contact us by email first.

Hi Marco,

That's great - I would love to hear about how CyGel works for you for
OpenSPIM/lightsheet - and I'm very curious about the two-component hydrogel
for live samples that does not require a temperature trigger.  It would be
great to hear about it on OpenSPIM if and when you can share details :)

Good luck!
Eric

Hi guys,

Thanks for the replies.

I will order the cygel and could let you know how I get on.
I had some inconclusive experiences with matrigel in the past too and would definitely be extremely interested by a gel that would polymerise by another route than temperature change.

Have a nice evening.

Best regards,
Arnaud Monnard.

Hi Arnaud,

I've never used it with OpenSPIM, or on a lightsheet system having a similar design for mounting, but CyGel or CyGel Sustain from BioStatus might work.  It offers improved optical clarity over agarose.  Also, it is a liquid at cold and becomes a solid at room temperature or higher, making it easy to recover live samples.  Its main drawback is cost but otherwise I really liked it when I tried it on a confocal and on a lattice lightsheet with live squid embryos and hatchlings.

I'd be curious to know how it goes, if you or others give it a try - or have tried it.

Subject: [micro-manager-general] Announcement: Micro-Manager 2.0 Alpha

 From: Chris Weisiger <cweisiger at msg.ucsf.edu>
To: Micro-Manager General <micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net>
Reply-To: Micro-Manager General

Folks, I'm pleased to announce that the first alpha build of 
Micro-Manager
2.0 is now available. Version 2.0 will be a major overhaul of
Micro-Manager's user interface (UI) and of the way the Java layer 
organizes
image data. It's designed to be easier to use than 1.4 (i.e. the current
official releases), while remaining backwards compatible with it. We'd
appreciate your assistance in testing it; while we've done a heck of a 
lot
of testing already, there's always the potential for bugs to sneak in
unnoticed.

Support for Micro-Manager 1.4 is going to continue for the foreseeable
future; we aren't going to shift all of our development focus to 2.0 
until
it's ready. Still, we believe that 2.0 is a major improvement over 1.4.
We've worked really hard to make this version of Micro-Manager the best 
it
can be. Examples of some of the many new features in the UI include:

  * An overhauled image display window with controls readily at hand
  * "Inspector" windows for easy access to histograms, metadata, and 
more,
allowing for side-by-side comparisons of multiple datasets
  * The ability to synchronize aspects of the display across multiple
windows, so windows can share histogram scalings, always show the same Z
slice, etc.
  * A user profile system so each user of the program can have their own
saved settings
  * Timestamp and scale bar overlays
  * A much better "day/night" system for more pleasant use in darkrooms

Here's a screenshot of the new UI:
http://i.imgur.com/PSqB8jJ.jpg

Additionally, the Java API has been vastly expanded and simplified (the
Core API is untouched). If you're a developer who works with 
Micro-Manager,
you should appreciate easy access to image data and metadata, control 
and
customization of image display windows, access to events, and more. On 
the
flip side, many old methods in the API are unfortunately no longer
available, so your plugins that depend on those methods will need to be
updated. We hope to keep this version of the API stable for many years 
to
come. For more information on the API, please see our wiki 
documentation:
https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Version_2.0

NOTE: as this is an alpha build, we cannot promise that it is "safe". It
does not modify the hardware control systems or the MDA, but data files 
it
generates will differ from data files generated in 1.4, if only in the
metadata. While I would love for people to try acquiring data with 2.0, 
I
can't recommend that you do serious, high-stakes science with it just 
yet.
Additionally, while 2.0 can read data files generated with 1.4, the 
reverse
may not be the case. Be careful about mixing files from 1.4 and 2.0.

You can download the most recent version of the alpha build from here:
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-alpha/Mac/
http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-alpha/Windows/

If you find bugs, please let us know! If you have comments or feedback,
please let us know! If you have questions or requests, please let us 
know!
You can email the main mailing list (
micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net) or our internal email 
address (
info at micro-manager.org) for more private reports. Either way, please put
"[2.0]" in the email subject line so we can easily recognize that your
email relates to the alpha.

Additionally, we are moving our development towards using GitHub. Our
GitHub account is here:
https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager

You can file bug reports via the "Issues" link in the top-right. If you
want to download the source code for 2.0, use the "mm2" branch, not the
"master" branch.

Thank you for your time, and thanks for using Micro-Manager!

Subject: [OpenSPIM] A trouble in initial hardware configuration of the laser
Message-ID: <tencent_4ABEA4450697CC43251C5CFC@qq.com>

Dear all,
   Today, I just did the initial hardware configuration, but there was something worng with the laser configuration. 
   The laser I used is LuxX® 488-60 Omicron and is connected to PC with USB line, and the laser can be controlled by the software provided by the manufacturer. When I add the laser in the hardware configuration wizard, it present a window but nothing in the list of the RS232 settings(the below pictrue, I don't know whether the pictrue can be show). And I try to click the "Scan" button, then alert a window tells that the port should be choosen manually. Also, when click the "OK" button, a window show and alert that "Serial command failed. Is the device connected to the serial port?". Therefore, the laser can not be added.
   Is there anyone else meet the trouble?  I hope for your help. Thank you!
   Best wishes!

Dear Zheng,

The chances are that you need to input the info yourself. Although we dod not have a Omicron laser, my gut feeling is that it is very similar to the Coherent lasers (CUBE and Obis) in that it uses a a 19,200 baud rate on a COM-port. I've never successfully used the "scan" button while creating a harware configuration.

Maybe there are other out there that can help you out more.

Regards,
Pete

Hi all, I hope the science treats you well.

I was wondering if anybody has a list of publications (and/or websites)
using the OpenSPIM or similar setup.  I'm pleased to say that I've
started to order parts for our build and I was curious to see more of
the data sets taken with this kind of setup.  I'm presenting to my
department in the week and need some representative data sets and
experiments.

I know of the PLOS paper from last year that investigates Ca sensing in
plant roots, but can't seem to find anything else.

I hope there are plenty more in the pipeline given that there are more
OpenSPIM setups out there.  I see 8 on the website, but are there more?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

I started a page on the OpenSPIM wiki:

     http://openspim.org/Publications

However, I feel a wiki should be edited by more than one person, so I 
did not do all that much on that page myself, still waiting for others 
to simply go and add their papers or papers related to OpenSPIM that 
they know about.

To answer your question, I turned to Google Scholar 
(https://scholar.google.com/) and searched for the term "OpenSPIM". 
Among the many reviews, there seem to be a couple of interesting "real" 
biology papers, e.g.:

     
http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=2241619

According to Picard systems (I asked a while ago), they have delivered 
at least 45 stages, so that is my conservative guess. Of course it would 
be nice to hear back from more people, given that our main aim was to 
start a collaborative community when we invested that insane amount of 
time and effort to make all of this IKEA grade instructions and a wiki 
and a mailing list.

So here is drinking to a vibrant community in the future!
Johannes

Of the three systems I know personally, including my own: one will likely
be used as a tech testbed, one has just started gathering data or will
start very soon and I have just started putting screws to the breadboard
on mine.  Between backordered parts and troubleshooting it should take
about a month (optimistically) for ours to start gathering data.

If my small circle is representative I predict a very steep increase in
publications in the next year or so.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] opening SPIM data with Bio-formats plugin
Message-ID: <3ae2f566cfac7070863073cc2583bfa1@nencki.gov.pl>

Hi,

recently some people were writing about some issues when opening 
acquired images with Bio-formats. It seems that the super-slowness was 
at leats partly the fault of the Bio-formats: at least in my case, after 
the recent Fiji update that included Bio-formats 5.1.3, speed improved.

There is another issue though. When I open data that consists of several 
files, the Bio-formats plugin asks me which sries to open, but no matter 
what I choose, ALL the open files have the same header: 
spim_TL01_Angle0.ome . Always Angle0. This makes opening all files and 
doing something with them impossible because the info which is which is 
lost. Also, in the metadata there is a line: " Series 2 Name	null" or 
similar. When collecting images directly with micromanager, this line 
looks more like " Series 0 Name	XYseries_1_MMStack_Pos1" and then the 
open windows have collect headers. So the metadata is not saved 
correctly.

If somebody knows how to fix quickly, I'll be grateful for a hint, 
otherwise I'll try myself.

Regards,
Monika

** The Future Home for µManager
------------------------------------------------------------


** User Service Program subscriptions available for pre-order
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Johannes,

As we previously announced, the µManager team is moving to a new company 
this fall. That new company is Open Imaging 
(http://open-imaging.us11.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=127807c7306171ababea968c8&id=025d0ebbe9&e=91db95b688) 
.

Open Imaging's µManager User Service Program 
(http://open-imaging.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=127807c7306171ababea968c8&id=b0e7f3e0c0&e=91db95b688) 
is now available for signup. The User Service Program is a 
subscription-based service that includes technical support and access to 
the latest pre-release versions of µManager. It will also be how we 
primarily finance future µManager development, so I hope you will 
consider subscribing if you use and like µManager. Service will begin on 
October 1, 2015, but you will get a discount for ordering early! Please 
see our website for details.

Yours sincerely,
Mark Tsuchida
CEO & Co-CTO

Hi All,

I'm constantly receiving this error when I try and acquire an image >4GB:

java.lang.RuntimeException: loci.formats.FormatException: File is too large; call setBigTiff(true)
at spim.progacq.AsyncOutputWrapper$2.run(AsyncOutputWrapper.java:113)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
Caused by: loci.formats.FormatException: File is too large; call setBigTiff(true)

at spim.progacq.AsyncOutputWrapper$2.run(AsyncOutputWrapper.java:98)

Any ideas how I may get around it, or are we restricted to image sizes <4GB for now?


Kind regards,


Gabriel Davis Jones

Hi Developers,

We plan to release Micro-Manager 1.4.22 on Friday, August 14 (slightly
later than our regular schedule).

In all likelyhood, this will be the last official release version from
the UCSF Micro-Manager Team. Starting in October, Open Imaging will be
providing annual releases as free downloads (see [1]). We'll continue
to publish nightly builds until Sept 30.

If you have SVN write access and are working on untested changes, it
will be a good idea to avoid committing them to SVN during the week
before the release. If you need to commit a last-minute fix on the day
of the release, please contact us by email first.
