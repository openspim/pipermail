Subject: [OpenSPIM] Clearing solvents and plastics? Delrin? Any experiences
	out there?
Message-ID: <CAM=c-cAM=hbwLyG3twWQzBvATWpBgeOJ4niokERh5tD_zrLLFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is my first build. It's a hybrid setup with non-dipping objectives.

Delrin is a great plastic with decent chemical compatibility.

Anybody build a chamber from Delrin?

We''ll be trying various clearing protocols. Unsure which ones, etc.

Anybody used Delrin? Success? Failed?

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Bio-Formats
Message-ID: <5a18daf16b244bef51c110610bc651e8@cam.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I had to re-install the Fiji-OpenSPIM software after replacing my C 
drive.
I enabled the update sites for Java-8 and Bio-Formats and updated Fiji.

Now I am getting the following error when starting the Micro-Manager 
plugin (before starting the OpenSPIM-Plugin in Micro-Manager):

"Jan 12, 2018 2:07:03 PM java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences openKey
WARNING: Could not open windows registry node 
Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\org\micromanager at root 0x80000002. Windows 
RegOpenKey(...) returned error code 5."


The acquisition seems to work, but whenever I try to open a single 
z-stack (ome.tif) Bio-Formats tries to open the entire time-lapse (and 
fails mostly cause they are too big).
This only happens with data I acquired after re-installing Fiji. When I 
drag an older ome.tif file into Fiji, it opens it without even starting 
Bio-Formats.

Does anyone have an idea what else I need to do? Is this a problem with 
Java or with Fiji or Bio-Formats?

I have noticed before that when dragging data into Fiji, it  opens the 
Bio-Formats window for some data, but not for others. Why is that?

Thank you very much for any input.

Best wishes,
Stephanie

Hi all, I hope the science and scopes are treating you well.



We are currently looking for an additional member to join our team of imaging experts in Emory University's Integrated Cellular Imaging (ICI) core facility.  The ICI is one of the largest microscopy core facilities in the south eastern region with 18 microscopes and 5 analysis workstations across 4 locations on Emory's main campus (http://www.cores.emory.edu/ici/).  We have multiple standard options such as widefield, confocal, and live cell spinning disk, together with advanced techniques including multiphoton, super-res, SPIM and lattice light sheet.  We are looking for a dedicated person passionate about imaging and helping life sciences researchers get the most out of today's cutting-edge microscopes and the ever-complicated data sets.



The role includes working with our light sheet and super-resolution microscopes (advising and assisting with acquisitions, and optimizing data analysis and post-acquisition workflows), together with troubleshooting and optimizing image acquisitions across multiple microscopes with an emphasis on quantitative data analysis.  In addition, the position requires regular meetings with researcher to train and assist with 2D/3D/4D data analyses using Fiji, CellProfiler, Imaris, Matlab etc.  Depending on interest and expertise there may also be threads of cloud computing and data logistics, 2D/3D/4D media and graphics, and more.



We're looking for a bachelors or masters level applicant with a passion for learning, helping, and attention to detail.  Ideal candidates should have experience with data analysis and a background that overlaps in one or more of the following subject areas: physics, optics, engineering, programming, or computer science.  While experience with fluorescence microscopy and biology is beneficial, it's not explicitly required, just an interest in learning the underlying principles of modern microscopy data.

In-Reply-To: <6237127c3edc499b80fe7feb60691846@tum.de>

Dear all,

the data saving problem I described in the last email still persists. I have now run out of ideas what to try and would be very grateful for any help.

The problem is the automatic saving to an output directory.
If no directory is defined, the acquisition can be completed successfully and the images saved as .tiff.
But when defining an output directory to save datasets as .ome.tiff, the acquisition fails as the plugin is not able to save images. The following error occurs (the complete CoreLog is attached):

java.lang.Error: Error acquiring!
   at spim.SPIMAcquisition$29.run(SPIMAcquisition.java:2042)
Caused by exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [B
   at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler$2.run(AsyncOutputHandler.java:111)
   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)
Caused by exception: java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [B
   at spim.io.OMETIFFHandler.processSlice(OMETIFFHandler.java:186)
   at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler.handleNext(AsyncOutputHandler.java:231)

   at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler$2.run(AsyncOutputHandler.java:96)
   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)

The log gives the following information, but saving does not work, even if the async writer is not selected:

The acquisition is RUNNING.
Async writer failed!
[WARNING] The current process takes longer than 5 secs delay.

or:

The acquisition is RUNNING.
The acquisition is DONE.
Async writer failed!
Estimated tiles count: 1.0
Tiles count: 1
calling setBigTiff(true)

So far I tried various versions of the OpenSPIM software (the package downloaded from openspim.org, a newer version and the most recent version updated today).
I included the update sites for: OpenSPIM, Micro-Manager-dev, Fiji, ImageJ, Java-8, Bio-Formats (in different combinations).
The error was reproducable on another computer and also on another operating system (windows 8 and windows 7).

Could it possibly be related to the setup we use? Instead of a Hamamatsu camera we use an Edmund Optics USB CCD Color camera.

Has anyone an idea how to solve the problem? Or any suggestion what else I might try?
Any help would be very much appreciated.

Thank you and kind regards,
Judith

Betreff: [OpenSPIM] Acquire SPIM image data saving and Anti-Drift problem

Dear all,

thank you very much for this great project and the effort you put in answering all these questions.

I spent the last few months building and aligning an OpenSpim microscope.
Now two problems are left I was not yet able to solve.

When defining an output directory and starting an acquisition, the Acquire SPIM image plugin throws an error ("Error acquiring: [I cannot be cast to [B") and stops the acquisition. Fiji then has to be restarted.
The error in the console reads:

java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [B
     at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler$2.run(AsyncOutputHandler.java:111)
     at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [B
     at spim.io.OMETIFFHandler.processSlice(OMETIFFHandler.java:186)
     at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler.handleNext(AsyncOutputHandler.java:231)
     at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler.access$300(AsyncOutputHandler.java:16)
     at spim.io.AsyncOutputHandler$2.run(AsyncOutputHandler.java:96)
     ... 1 more

The second problem is that I do not know how to use the Anti-Drift function. I am able to manually alter the position, but when selecting automatic application of the
suggested value nothing changes and the sample just keeps drifting out of the field of view.

Has anyone encountered these problems before or has an idea how to solve them?

Thank you very much,
Judith

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone has any advice/experience they'd like to share on how to implement heating (up to 37C) and 5% CO2 supply to a SPIM sample chamber.  What samples  do you image and over what kind of time frame?

Thanks for the help,

Matt

Message-ID: <CAHmtN7kpnNHPYiknv+ADOrWVYL0k5CKMtS3iJg9Ehj2tOsRTig@mail.gmail.com>

Matt,

I haven't had a need for CO2 yet so I can't help you there but I have been
successfully heating my chamber to 27C for up to 24 hours. Longer wouldn't
be a problem. Samples are largely zebrafish. The chamber is anodized
aluminum and the liquid volume is 150mL. I cap the chamber to slow
evaporation while leaving a hole for the sample mount to move. I went the
simple route and attached two polyimide encapsulated  copper foils, via
PSA, to the chamber bottom paired with a very low tech controller, an NTC
thermistor and an old 12V laptop power supply. The foils and controller are
from Minco (https://www.minco.com/Components/Shop-by-Product). Your chamber
size will dictate the specific foil but an example would be, say, part
number HK6912. The controller I used is the CT325. Throw in a fuse to keep
OHS moderately happy. You'll need to calculate the thermal mass of your
chamber plus medium (plus anything the chamber touches i.e. transfer heat)
and the warm-up time blah blah and match the parts correctly but that's all
straightforward. My chamber warms up from 18C to 27C in about 10 minutes.
Put the thermistor as close as you can to the sample. I put a temp probe in
an agarose mount and adjusted the CT325 to give me 27 at the probe. It's
not sexy but it works and it was cheap at ~$200 USD.

If I wanted CO2 control, I would probably do nothing fancier than a well
sealed plexi box around the sample chamber and stage. Feed in heated
CO2/air dual gas (or air/N2/CO2 tri-gas) at a slight positive pressure and
you don't need CO2 controllers. I would include an IR sensor (not a wet
sensor) as it's good form and allow record keeping. Add a gas pressure
sensor and wire every sensor into a beagle bone to record all the data. You
might find an old system designed for a microscope nobody wants anymore and
up-cycle the parts. I would put the stage inside the box as a bigger box is
way cheaper and simpler than soft sealing the sample holder arm. Or go
crazy and box everything but the camera and lasers with opaque plexi and
you get gas, temp and safety all in one. Send me photos if you build one.

Good luck.
