Hi Neil,

I'm afraid I'm mostly guessing at details; Pete Pitrone at MPI probably knows more, but here's my best answers:


1. It looks like a Melles Griot SafeClose shutter, 04LSC001
2. If the above is correct, this shutter uses a 9V signal to open and closes in the absence thereof; it doesn't have a direct interface to Micro-Manager, but it may be possible through some programmable microcontroller.
3. The prototype did, but one day it levitated through the ceiling and left for outer space. We haven't heard from it since, and attempts to reproduce the behavior have so far been met with no success. ;-)


Hope this helps!
Luke

Hello Luke and Niel,

The design renderings were done by Michael Weber for the Nature Methods coorespondence letter. They unfortunately did not take them. The model number of the shutter is beyond me, but Luke is probably correct? Michael, can you answer this one?

As to the levitation capabilities of OpenSPIM; I could tell you, but then I would have to kill you. :-\

Regards,
Pete

Hi Neil,


the T- (as well as the X-) SPIM where just conceptual designs to show the potential of OpenSPIM. I was briefly looking for shutters and as Luke pointed out, it?s a Melles Griot shutter. I did not check for compatibility with Micromanager. There are several possible integrations of double-sided illumination, if you planning to build one of the more advanced configurations. Shutters, AOTF, two lasers, 50/50 splitter. Let us know if you need more advice on that.


Best regards,

Michael

Dear Jean and Michael,

Yes, my lab (LOCI, www.loci.wisc.edu) is part of a consortium, called OpenSPIM (www.openspim.org) that uses the Picard motors for light sheet microscopy. We use both the picard DLL and micromanager as part of these efforts and has worked very well. 


Are you trying to use the picard motors for SPIM, Michael? Are you using OpenSPIM? If so and you are having trouble please ask us for help. I've cced the developer list.


Michael, you refer to problems with micromanager, I also use this project for several other applications in my lab and been pleased with it and their support. I encourage you to ask the micromanager list (at https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) any questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.

kevin

Thanks for the suggestions Luke!

Yes, it's only with acquisition or sometimes, when I double-click the
position in the position list.  When I'm using the stage controls tab, the
motor responds immediately.

Pixel size is set.

Yes, no error message appears, but actually it looks like some do appear in
the core log.  I've attached one.  It's long, but the error occurred twice
in the last 4-angle acquisition, starting at about 16:32:17.
By the way, there are also some errors in this log regarding the camera
(e.g. "Camera Image Read Buffer Failed" at about 16:32:14; I sometimes get
an "Error acquiring: null" message from the camera that I have been
ignoring because about 50% of the time it goes away when I abort and
restart the acquisition, but if you have any advice about this I would be
grateful).

To explain what I was doing I attach a screenshot of the position list and
the stage controls after acquisition has finished.  You can see that at the
end of acquisition, the z stage is where it should be but the y stage is at
the position of the previous row (the 0 angle row).  Then suddenly, at
16:38, the stage spontaneously moved to the correct y position (the last
screenshot, and you can see that now the specimen is visible).

I hope this is useful.  Thank you!

Coherent is replacing their Cube laser with their Obis line. The Obis is USB connectable and is much cheaper than the Cube. Has anyone used an Obis laser with OpenSPIM or micromanager?

Hi Michael,

I know our colleagues in Germany have used both and been pleased. Only issue was need cleanup filter in both cases. There are now drivers on github for micromanger control of obis
but we have not to my knowledge tried this. See?https://github.com/hc5/CoherentOBIS

Hello Michael,

We did use OBIS for a few months due to a defective CUBE, and it worked very well? But at the time we did not have it integrated into the plugin, so unless the driver can be merged into it then I cannot make any statement for or against getting one. Otherwise when this merger is accomplished I would say go for it, with the caveat of getting a clean up filter (eGFP excitation of 490/10 or 490/15 ?400 USD/GBP/EUR) along side it.

My $0.02,
Pete

Hello Christian,

 

Sorry to hear about your troubles with our USB-4D-Stage software.

The DLL files should have been loaded in the  C:\Program Files\Picard
Industries\USB 4D-Stage Application directory.

Check to see if they are there.

Are you able to run the Stage with our Windows application for testing?

If so, then the DLL files must be there (somewhere), the application uses
them. 

 

If you have any question with using Micro Manager, I encourage you to ask
the micromanager list (at
<https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community>
https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) with any
questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of
the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I
know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.

 

As for my French, I grew-up with French speaking parents (from Quebec) so I
did learn to speak French.

But I was born in the States (Vermont) and went to English schools.

There is very little opportunity to speak French here, except with family. 

I would need to move to Quebec (or France) to regain my full use of my
original language.

If I did, I am sure it would come back quickly.

Thanks (Merci)

Installation 


Download the USB 4D stage software
<http://www.picard-industries.com/products.html#usb-4d-stage>  from Picard.
Run the installer, and also copy the file 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\Win32\PiUsb.dll (for 32-bit Micro-Manager) or 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\x64\PiUsb.dll (for 64-bit Micro-Manager) into your Micro-Manager
folder.


But unfortunatly I do not find the 4D-stage DLL in the package that I
download from your site. Could you help in in that purpose ?

Merci (are you speaking  French ?)

Hello everyone,

I am working on configuring the Nikon 1v3 Digital Camera to micro 
manager (this camera is not supported by the micro-manager), to use it 
in openSPIM. Can anyone please tell me how this can be done? Any useful 
links or resources? Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you

Hi Everyone,


We recently moved our open-SPIM set up from a Windows XP machine to a Windows 7 machine.  Everything is working except when we try to save our stacks to disk instead of RAM.  If Asynchronous Output is not selected nothing happens - Oh-Snap changes to ?Abort? and the bar underneath says ?Not Acquiring?.  If Asynchronous Output is selected the laser flashes once and we get the following message:

?Wrapped throwable; see core log for details: com/esotericsoftware/kryo/KryoSerialable?

The Log is attached.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dear Kieran and Ricarda,

To my knowledge, the export of .czi data from the ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1 should be not necessary any more.
The .czi data  can be read directly by Bioformats reader into Fiji ?

Kevin Eliceiri and Stephan Preibisch are the experts in this ?

Pls let me know if I can help in that data from ZEISS microscopes can be opened in the software where you need it.

With best regards,
Olaf

Richard,

The endianness of the TIFF data might be wrong (wrong byte order). Try switching to intel-byte order (or if it already is, switch it to big endian).

Here is what I have found to work with our Z1 data:

The newest version of Bioformats can read and open the .CZI file off the microscope.  As Bioformats opens the file, it opens each view as a separate stack and gives you the option of which ones you want to open.  As long as your system has enough RAM, you can open individual, or all views, and then convert to .tif using Fiji.  If any of the views exceed your RAM, you will have to open them as a virtual stack, convert to .tif and downsample before running the registration/fusion plugins.

If your data was subsetted in ZEN by anything other than time (channel/view/etc) during acquisition, it will not open in Bioformats.
Bioformats still seems to have problems reading certain multi-channel files.  I have sent them some test data sets, but haven?t heard back yet.

When all-else fails, the following protocol seems to work:


1)      Subset your original file into individual .czi files for channel and view (don?t worry about time point).  Do this using the Processing<Copy<File Subset command in ZEN, NOT File<New File Browser.

2)      You can then batch convert these .CZI files to .tif files using Fiji.

3)      These files can then be registered/fused/deconvolved

If anyone has other/better suggestions, I?d be happy to hear them.

This is certainly new. The Bio-Formats writer seems to be loading that serialization class when it attempts to open the first OME-TIFF file for writing. Some questions:
- Are you saving the images anywhere unusual (i.e. a network drive), as opposed to a local disk?
- Have you updated Bio-Formats on the new machine? Are you using the daily build or the release version?
- Do you have other update sites enabled that might also be using this library?
- Does the following file exist: <OpenSPIM.app>/jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar?
Please make sure your installation is totally up to do date (have a look at the Fiji FAQ[1] to be completely sure).


> The Log is attached.


Would it be possible to get a more complete log file, i.e. one of the CoreLogYYYYMMDD files from the application directory? It's possible there are details near the start of the program that could shed some light on this.


Thanks!
Luke


[1]?http://fiji.sc/FAQ#How_can_I_verify_that_my_Fiji_is_really_100.25_up_to_date.3F contains an in-depth guide to making sure every file is up to date.

On OS X and Linux, the GPhoto device adapter can drive at least some
Nikon cameras. On Windows (32-bit only), the NKRemoteCamera adapter
works with some Nikon DSLRs, although it depends on a commercial
library. However, I have not tried either of these adapters, and I don't
know if either will work (both theoretically and practically) with the
Nikon 1.

Best,
Mark

Dear Douglas,

This is what we do as well. Its not perfect, but it works. I guess we should document it on the wiki, but better Fiji then OpenSPIM since this is a LZ1 specific issue.

I have something like that here, but it deals exclusively with headless operation on a cluster http://fiji.sc/SPIM_Registration_on_cluster

Sending data to bioformats is a great idea, they are working on it.

All the best

Hi all,

It turns out using the advanced mode updater as described in the FIJI FAQ did the trick. Everything seems to be working normally now and the asynchronous write-to-disk works as expected. We must have had something out of date in the Bio-Formats writer.

Thanks for your help,

damian

This is certainly new. The Bio-Formats writer seems to be loading that serialization class when it attempts to open the first OME-TIFF file for writing. Some questions:
- Are you saving the images anywhere unusual (i.e. a network drive), as opposed to a local disk?
- Have you updated Bio-Formats on the new machine? Are you using the daily build or the release version?
- Do you have other update sites enabled that might also be using this library?
- Does the following file exist: <OpenSPIM.app>/jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar?
Please make sure your installation is totally up to do date (have a look at the Fiji FAQ[1] to be completely sure).


> The Log is attached.


Would it be possible to get a more complete log file, i.e. one of the CoreLogYYYYMMDD files from the application directory? It's possible there are details near the start of the program that could shed some light on this.


Thanks!
Luke


[1]?http://fiji.sc/FAQ#How_can_I_verify_that_my_Fiji_is_really_100.25_up_to_date.3F contains an in-depth guide to making sure every file is up to date.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] T-spim
Message-ID: <1C4F27D9-EAB9-42AE-A151-2FBB4485BFAB@hci.utah.edu>

For those who have built a T-SPIM, I have a several questions. The first question is about creating the second illumination light sheet.  The T-SPIM drawing in the OPENSPIM gallery, a mirror is placed near the laser that splits the light between two identical light paths each complete with cylindrical lenses etc.. My question is rather than creating two identical light paths with many optical components, why can't a the light sheet be created in a single light path and a splitting mirror be placed at the end prior to the 10x Olympus dipping lens and routed with mirrors to the back of the other 10x dipping lens.  The second question concerns shuttering the laser. Does anyone have any  shutters that they would recommend for use with a T-SPIM? Finally, does anyone have a digital plans for a T-SPIM sample chamber?

thanks

Michael Redd

Hello Christian,

 

Sorry about your troubles with Micromanager.

I have no experience with this software.

But, I am hoping one of the people on the CC list (above) will respond to
your email soon.

They are the people that have developed the software to bridge Micromanager
to our software DLL that controls the 4D-Stage.

Let me know if you are still having problems, I can contact them directly
for you.

Thanks

Hello Christian,

 

Sorry to hear about your troubles with our USB-4D-Stage software.

The DLL files should have been loaded in the  C:\Program Files\Picard
Industries\USB 4D-Stage Application directory.

Check to see if they are there.

Are you able to run the Stage with our Windows application for testing?

If so, then the DLL files must be there (somewhere), the application uses
them. 

 

If you have any question with using Micro Manager, I encourage you to ask
the micromanager list (at
<https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community>
https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) with any
questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of
the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I
know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.

 

As for my French, I grew-up with French speaking parents (from Quebec) so I
did learn to speak French.

But I was born in the States (Vermont) and went to English schools.

There is very little opportunity to speak French here, except with family. 

I would need to move to Quebec (or France) to regain my full use of my
original language.

If I did, I am sure it would come back quickly.

Thanks (Merci)

Dear Christian,

Yes, we routinely use and works fine. When you install the driver, you are saying Micromanager won't see? Luke can you help?

Hi Christian,

1) Make sure you are using a recent nightly build of Micro-Manager
(the Picard device adapter has been in the OpenSPIM project for a
while but was added to the official Micro-Manager project just _after_
the 1.4.17 release).

https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Nightly_Builds

2) You do not need to copy the Picard DLLs (they are included in the
Micro-Manager installer) if you use a nightly build since 20140519.

Best,
Mark

Hi Ke,

first of all: welcome to the OpenSPIM community! It is an exciting project
and it is good that so many people start building their own SPIM setups
and start sharing their experiences.

Especially in this light, though, I'd like to point out I do not discuss
Open Source (or, as in this case, Open Hardware) in private mails (unless
I am paid for it specifically, and I would charge what my work is truly
worth). Therefore, I Cc:ed the OpenSPIM mailing list and encourage you to
reply-to-all.

Hmm... Typically, this means that the serial number is wrong... You should
be able to set it in the properties in the wizard.

That is valuable information, thanks for sharing. I half suspected the
cable to be faulty.

Well, I hope that the above comment helps you solve the problem!

Has anyone built a T-SPIM system? It seems like a good idea on paper.  Are there good reasons not to build a T-SPIM?

Hello Michael,

Yes, we have. I have designs for the Olympus line of water dipping objectives and for a mixture of Olympus illumination objectives and the Nikon 16x/0.8. Carsten Wolff has this setup in Berlin.

I can get you plans for either or both in the very near future. 

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Johannes,

Thanks so much for answering my question!

I tried your suggestion. While the problem is that I can't add the Z stage
in the wizard so I have no access to the properties and can't change the
serial number of the Z stage. (I can change the serial numbers of XY stage
after I add them.)

I have tried different cables and the problem still exists.

What other potential reasons can cause this problem? Is there any way to
solve the problem? Do you think generate a problem report helps?

Thanks,
Ke

Hi Mark,

I'm Ke, the graduate student asked you questions related to the USB 4D
stage of Picard Industry about three weeks ago. Thanks for answering my
questions before. Now I encounter some problems.

1. I still can't add the Z stage when I create the hardware configuration.
I tried both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows system, neither can work. Since the
problem report doesn't give much info, I'm not sure whether there are other
ways to solve this problem? And what possible reasons can cause the
problem?

2. As for the steps of installing the OpenSPIM/Fiji package, I can't find
the *Micro-Manager* or *Micro-Manager studio* when I click the plugins in
the Micro-Manager (*Plugins->Micro-Manager->Micro-Manager Studio)* I'm
using in my windows 7 64-bit system, which is the newest version.
[image: Inline image 1]

3. And is the windows 7 64-bit system a potential problem for hardware
control since Window XP 32-bit is the required system? Can the Windows 7
64-bit system be the reason that I can't add the Z stage (But the XY stage
works well and I tried to add the stage in the 32-bit XP system, the Z
stage still can't be added)?

Thanks,
Ke

Are you sure you have the correct serial number for the Z stage (as
Johannes suggested)? In the problem report you sent us, it looked like
you had not set the serial number when adding the Z stage in the
Hardware Configuration Wizard. This causes the device adapter to use the
serial number "-1", which always results in an error.

Do you see a field to enter the serial number for the Z stage? If you cannot
get it to work even when entering the correct serial number, could you try
sending another Problem Report?

Here is the relevant section of the log you sent:

I'll let the OpenSPIM folks address these questions. For the Picard
stage specifically, there is no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work
on Windows 7 64 bit, but we have not tested the stage here.

Sorry, I hadn't seen your reply to Johannes that answered that question of mine.

I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected to the
computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization settings
(including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
configuration wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage,
but not the XY stage (at least on my computer).

Johannes, I also found the cause: OnSerialGeneric() is calling the
Initialize() function, which fails. This happens before the Hardware
Wizard calls Initialize (actually, when the wizard is trying to get
the initial values of the pre-init properties), so the wizard has no
chance to display the configuration dialog.

Simply taking out the calls to Initialize (PicardStage.cpp lines
243-245, 258) seems to fix this, but I'm not sure if that is all that
needs to be done (since I don't have a Picard stage and cannot figure
out what the intent of calling Initialize() at this point was).
Johannes, can you take a look at this?

Best,
Mark

The intent of the Initialize call was to test the serial number received from the Pi-detector, but I didn't account for the possibility of CPiDetector returning DEFAULT_SERIAL_UNKNOWN, which it does if the requested device hadn't been found. I'm preparing a fix for this that I will submit via SVN as soon as possible.


The ultimate issue is this: The Pi-detector only tested serial numbers up to 250. I've doubled this for now, but this is a stop-gap measure that causes an ugly pause in the device adding process while it probes the serial numbers; I will need to seek a different approach to detecting the motors.


I'll report back after fixing/testing and committing/uploading the device adapter.

Hi all (mainly to Ke),

Just a word from my experience using Win7/64bit. Ke - in order for Picard's
own application to work, you need to have the serial numbers for the XY, Z
and R components exactly right. I didn't receive any documentation on what
to do. I just copied the serial numbers that i saw in some simple
documentation that came with it... but using these never got the Picard
application to work. However, the OpenSPIM system worked fine. Anyway,
after having this for some months (and just putting down the Picard program
not working to some weird bug), I only realised today when the serial
number stickers on the 4d stage itself jumped out at me (which aren't
hidden, they're pretty obvious actually now that I look at them!). Anyway,
entering in *those* number, *ding* the Picard application worked, and I
could control the application from that piece of software. FWIW, our
serials were 198, 199, 200. R was much lower, 60-something. :)
What I've also found, is that the "home" position was never set correctly
until I managed to get the 4D stage to properly talk to its own software. X
and Y were extending far too much into the sample chamber. Now that we
could properly 'Home' the stage in its own software once, it's much better
now and we have much better range. :)

Other comments about Win7/6: In our hands the Fiji/ImageJ and the
Micromanager>OpenSpim plugin work fine. I launch it as a WindowsXP/32 bit
compatibility application and it seems to be happy so far. It didn't like
being opened natively. I also tried compiling a Win7/64 build from GIT, but
I never spent the time to properly work out how to roll the plugins for the
hardware into it, so on that basis it never worked properly. As for the
system itself, we still haven't actually captured anything yet as we've had
all sorts of fun getting the sample chamber right -- and we're just
aligning/calibrating it now. But the stage, camera, and laser are all
happily being controlled by the OpenSPIM micromanager plugin.

cheers,
Kieran

Hi Luke,

In that case, maybe you can remove the call to Initialize() from the
BeforeGet branch of OnGenericSerial() (if you insist that the serial
number must be checked immediately when the user enters it, instead of
when the OK button is clicked).

Best,
Mark

Hi Guys,

might I ask what the issue is with the OBIS that requires a clean up?  I 
guess I'm wrong in thinking that a diode laser would only emit one 
wavelength (or very small spectral bandwidth)?

Thanks
Neil

I guess this is valuable information for the FAQ on the OpenSPIM Wiki!

Yeah, I guess that the problem is that we only drive it as a 32-bit
application here, so we probably forgot to include the 64-bit drivers ;-)

Yeah, this is currently in flux. The Picard Stage driver adapter made it
into Micro-Manager proper, so we no longer have to compile the C++ part,
really, unless we improve or fix the adapter. But we did not yet have time
to reflect that in the Wiki.

Awesome! Feel free to add a photo of your setup to
http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F!

And I am curious: what were the problems with the sample chamber? It might
be useful information for the FAQ, too, to save other OpenSPIMmers some
time...

I am really happy to see more and more OpenSPIM systems cropping up, this
is exciting!

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello Niel,

The 488ish nm model emits a unmeasurable (with a meeter) amount of green
light that can still be seen due to our eye's spectral response... Use an
emission filter to block the laser and see what comes out of the other
side.

Pete

Hi everyone,

And so here I am. I've committed the changes to SVN and uploaded the 32-bit version of the DLL to the OpenSPIM update site.


Mark -- Following your suggestion, those lines were removed -- in hindsight, it's not really the correct behavior, and the possible issue with obtaining an invalid serial number shouldn't be common at all. Thanks!


Kieran -- I recently became aware of the homing problem; the stage sometimes resets its internal location (when it loses power, perhaps?), so over time it will be pushed away. The X/Y stage can be homed using the MM Script Panel, running mmc.home("Picard XY Stage") -- the Z stage has no appropriate API call, so for the time being, there is a property "GoHome" that will home that stage when set to 1. It's a workaround until I can submit a more useful patch to the MM team (though, as an API change, that may take a little while).


Ke -- Please let me know if there are any more problems; hope this helps!


Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much. Could you please send the link of the changed version to
me? And since my system is 64-bit, how can I solve the Z stage problem (no
field to change the serial number since I can't add the Z stage first)?

Thanks,
Ke

Hi Ke,

You still can add the seral number to the Z in the Picard
application/program. This is totally independent of micromanager.

The other thing is, the 4D stage axes are labeled with stickers which have
2 bits of info . 1st is stage name and the other is the serial number. The
stage name doesn't necessarily represent what you think it does. Our "Z"
actually translates the stage toward and away from the detection objective!
That doesn't really matter though, I see Z as just a name that doesn't
truly reflect its function. It still works fine.

Once you enter in the correct serial number in the Picard application the
indicators for the stage communication in the software should turn from red
to green.

The picard software is*very* strict about this serial number setting. I
could use just about any numbers and micromanager worked -- but this really
wont.
My feeling is that if you at least have picards app working you will know
if its a "driver" problem or not.

It'll make Luke's job a lot easier if this is done. Have you already done
this and is there communication between the 4d stage and its own software
once you have entered tge correct serial numbers?

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

Thanks for your detailed info. The 4D stage can be controlled normally by
the software from Picard in my system. While I just can't add the Z stage
when I try to create the hardware configuration wizard by micro-manager. So
there is no place I can put the serial number of the Z stage in. (I can add
XY stage and the twister normally and change -1 into the correct serial
number of the XY stage).

I can also reproduce the problem exactly as what Mark did and encountered
(From Mark: I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected
to the computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization
settings (including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
configuration
wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage, but not the XY stage
(at least on my computer).)

Thanks,
Ke

Hello,
I am afraid that after updating to the newest PicardStage dll, my previous
configuration is unable to load the stage.  I get an error message:

Line 8: Device,Picard Twister,PicardStage,Picard Twister
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 9: Device,Picard Z Stage,PicardStage,Picard Z Stage
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 10: Device,Picard XY Stage,PicardStage,Picard XY Stage
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 23: Property,Picard Z Stage,Serial Number,181

Line 29: Property,Picard XY Stage,Y-Min,1
No device with label "Picard XY Stage"

Line 44: Property,Core,Focus,Picard Z Stage
Cannot set Core property Focus to invalid value "Picard Z Stage"

I can still load the camera and my shutter.  The Picard Stage now appears
unavailable in the hardware configuration wizard.  I am also using 32-bit
Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven't had trouble loading the stage before
(it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional
communication delay that I mentioned earlier).  I attach a core log.

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about that; it seems a lot more had changed than I had expected. I've updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there's still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.


Thanks!
Luke

Hi Michael,

creating two separate light sheets has a couple of advantages. You are more flexible in setting up the system, and you can compensate better for potential deviations due to differences in lenses etc. I fear that creating a single light sheet and splitting it afterwards can be difficult to set up and align, because you have to consider the length of your optical paths. And the required additional splitters and mirrors potentially introduce aberrations.

I just picked the shutter in the T-SPIM concept because they are small and there was a 3D model available? but I believe people already built T-SPIM, right?! Using a 50/50 splitter and two AOTF/AOM (or two diode lasers) is another option.

Modifying the chamber for more than two lenses is straight forward, I think Pete already has a 3D model for that?!

Best,
Michael

The T-SPIM drawing in the OPENSPIM gallery, a mirror is placed near the laser that splits the light between two identical light paths each complete with cylindrical lenses etc.. My question is rather than creating two identical light paths with many optical components, why can't a the light sheet be created in a single light path and a splitting mirror be placed at the end prior to the 10x Olympus dipping lens and routed with mirrors to the back of the other 10x dipping lens.  The second question concerns shuttering the laser. Does anyone have any  shutters that they would recommend for use with a T-SPIM? Finally, does anyone have a digital plans for a T-SPIM sample chamber?

Hi Luke,

Thank you!  I am still having a problem, probably because I'm using a
nonstandard setup.  There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a
PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I
try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in
use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I
load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3."  The
shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don't run into this
conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24
June.  I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.
The Picard stage now appears in the list of available hardware, but when I
try to load all three the computer bluescreens.

Thanks again,
Aurelia

You'll want to download the nightly build from 20140627 or later to

If you're using the usual OpenSPIM installation from our website, you may also be able to obtain the changes by running the ImageJ Updater (Help -> Update...) -- however, some issues with this update have been reported, and I'm still working on resolving them; though updating may fix the problem you are encountering, it may cause some others. I'll do my best to keep the mailing list up-to-date on my progress.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

> Thank you! I am still having a problem, probably because I&#39;m using a nonstandard setup. There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.



Do the devices work individually in OpenSPIM? i.e. if only one is loaded, do you ever get that message? It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn't updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I'll also be looking into this.

Load all three devices (camera, shutter, stage), or load all three stages? Does it bluescreen reliably? (I've not seen/heard of this happening before...)


I'll let you know what I work out. Thanks again!
Luke

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier).

Hi Aurelia,

Could you attach your configuration file, and report your system specs (OS version/architecture) as well? The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I'm still not entirely certain what's going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren't correct, they probably wouldn't load at all, so presumably you've already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)


Thanks,
Luke

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier). I attach a core log.

Hi,

One further thought -- the Java error at the top of the log file comes from a conflict in rsyntaxtextarea.jar (some e-mails on the MM mailing list discuss this issue, and we're working on porting Fiji/IJ2 to a newer version of the jar) -- I expected that having these in conflict would only disable the Micro-Manager script editor, but some testing suggests it might be more disruptive than that. Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".


Thanks again,
Luke

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I'm still not entirely certain what's going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren't correct, they probably wouldn't load at all, so presumably you've already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier).

Hi Neil,

I'm afraid I'm mostly guessing at details; Pete Pitrone at MPI probably knows more, but here's my best answers:


1. It looks like a Melles Griot SafeClose shutter, 04LSC001
2. If the above is correct, this shutter uses a 9V signal to open and closes in the absence thereof; it doesn't have a direct interface to Micro-Manager, but it may be possible through some programmable microcontroller.
3. The prototype did, but one day it levitated through the ceiling and left for outer space. We haven't heard from it since, and attempts to reproduce the behavior have so far been met with no success. ;-)


Hope this helps!
Luke

Hello Luke and Niel,

The design renderings were done by Michael Weber for the Nature Methods coorespondence letter. They unfortunately did not take them. The model number of the shutter is beyond me, but Luke is probably correct… Michael, can you answer this one?

As to the levitation capabilities of OpenSPIM; I could tell you, but then I would have to kill you. :-\

Regards,
Pete

Hi Neil,


the T- (as well as the X-) SPIM where just conceptual designs to show the potential of OpenSPIM. I was briefly looking for shutters and as Luke pointed out, it’s a Melles Griot shutter. I did not check for compatibility with Micromanager. There are several possible integrations of double-sided illumination, if you planning to build one of the more advanced configurations. Shutters, AOTF, two lasers, 50/50 splitter. Let us know if you need more advice on that.


Best regards,

Michael

Dear Jean and Michael,

Yes, my lab (LOCI, www.loci.wisc.edu) is part of a consortium, called OpenSPIM (www.openspim.org) that uses the Picard motors for light sheet microscopy. We use both the picard DLL and micromanager as part of these efforts and has worked very well. 


Are you trying to use the picard motors for SPIM, Michael? Are you using OpenSPIM? If so and you are having trouble please ask us for help. I've cced the developer list.


Michael, you refer to problems with micromanager, I also use this project for several other applications in my lab and been pleased with it and their support. I encourage you to ask the micromanager list (at https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) any questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.


best
kevin

Thanks for the suggestions Luke!

Yes, it's only with acquisition or sometimes, when I double-click the
position in the position list.  When I'm using the stage controls tab, the
motor responds immediately.

Pixel size is set.

Yes, no error message appears, but actually it looks like some do appear in
the core log.  I've attached one.  It's long, but the error occurred twice
in the last 4-angle acquisition, starting at about 16:32:17.
By the way, there are also some errors in this log regarding the camera
(e.g. "Camera Image Read Buffer Failed" at about 16:32:14; I sometimes get
an "Error acquiring: null" message from the camera that I have been
ignoring because about 50% of the time it goes away when I abort and
restart the acquisition, but if you have any advice about this I would be
grateful).

To explain what I was doing I attach a screenshot of the position list and
the stage controls after acquisition has finished.  You can see that at the
end of acquisition, the z stage is where it should be but the y stage is at
the position of the previous row (the 0 angle row).  Then suddenly, at
16:38, the stage spontaneously moved to the correct y position (the last
screenshot, and you can see that now the specimen is visible).

I hope this is useful.  Thank you!

Coherent is replacing their Cube laser with their Obis line. The Obis is USB connectable and is much cheaper than the Cube. Has anyone used an Obis laser with OpenSPIM or micromanager?

Cheers

Hi Michael,

I know our colleagues in Germany have used both and been pleased. Only issue was need cleanup filter in both cases. There are now drivers on github for micromanger control of obis
but we have not to my knowledge tried this. See https://github.com/hc5/CoherentOBIS

Hello Michael,

We did use OBIS for a few months due to a defective CUBE, and it worked very well… But at the time we did not have it integrated into the plugin, so unless the driver can be merged into it then I cannot make any statement for or against getting one. Otherwise when this merger is accomplished I would say go for it, with the caveat of getting a clean up filter (eGFP excitation of 490/10 or 490/15 ±400 USD/GBP/EUR) along side it.

My $0.02,
Pete

Hello Christian,

 

Sorry to hear about your troubles with our USB-4D-Stage software.

The DLL files should have been loaded in the  C:\Program Files\Picard
Industries\USB 4D-Stage Application directory.

Check to see if they are there.

Are you able to run the Stage with our Windows application for testing?

If so, then the DLL files must be there (somewhere), the application uses
them. 

 

If you have any question with using Micro Manager, I encourage you to ask
the micromanager list (at
<https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community>
https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) with any
questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of
the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I
know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.

 

As for my French, I grew-up with French speaking parents (from Quebec) so I
did learn to speak French.

But I was born in the States (Vermont) and went to English schools.

There is very little opportunity to speak French here, except with family. 

I would need to move to Quebec (or France) to regain my full use of my
original language.

If I did, I am sure it would come back quickly.

Thanks (Merci)

Hello John,

I am trying to install the 4D stage under Micro Manager software. (I am
involved in the project with F . Brau  that order the stage)
Reading the instruction under the installation of that device into the
MManager website https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/PicardStage
(here is a copy :

Installation 


Download the USB 4D stage software
<http://www.picard-industries.com/products.html#usb-4d-stage>  from Picard.
Run the installer, and also copy the file 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\Win32\PiUsb.dll (for 32-bit Micro-Manager) or 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\x64\PiUsb.dll (for 64-bit Micro-Manager) into your Micro-Manager
folder.


But unfortunatly I do not find the 4D-stage DLL in the package that I
download from your site. Could you help in in that purpose ?

Merci (are you speaking  French ?)

Hi Everyone,


We recently moved our open-SPIM set up from a Windows XP machine to a Windows 7 machine.  Everything is working except when we try to save our stacks to disk instead of RAM.  If Asynchronous Output is not selected nothing happens - Oh-Snap changes to “Abort” and the bar underneath says “Not Acquiring”.  If Asynchronous Output is selected the laser flashes once and we get the following message:

“Wrapped throwable; see core log for details: com/esotericsoftware/kryo/KryoSerialable”

The Log is attached.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Kieran and Ricarda,

To my knowledge, the export of .czi data from the ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1 should be not necessary any more.
The .czi data  can be read directly by Bioformats reader into Fiji …

Kevin Eliceiri and Stephan Preibisch are the experts in this …

Pls let me know if I can help in that data from ZEISS microscopes can be opened in the software where you need it.

With best regards,
Olaf

Richard,

The endianness of the TIFF data might be wrong (wrong byte order). Try switching to intel-byte order (or if it already is, switch it to big endian).

Here is what I have found to work with our Z1 data:

The newest version of Bioformats can read and open the .CZI file off the microscope.  As Bioformats opens the file, it opens each view as a separate stack and gives you the option of which ones you want to open.  As long as your system has enough RAM, you can open individual, or all views, and then convert to .tif using Fiji.  If any of the views exceed your RAM, you will have to open them as a virtual stack, convert to .tif and downsample before running the registration/fusion plugins.

If your data was subsetted in ZEN by anything other than time (channel/view/etc) during acquisition, it will not open in Bioformats.
Bioformats still seems to have problems reading certain multi-channel files.  I have sent them some test data sets, but haven’t heard back yet.

When all-else fails, the following protocol seems to work:


1)      Subset your original file into individual .czi files for channel and view (don’t worry about time point).  Do this using the Processing<Copy<File Subset command in ZEN, NOT File<New File Browser.

2)      You can then batch convert these .CZI files to .tif files using Fiji.

3)      These files can then be registered/fused/deconvolved

If anyone has other/better suggestions, I’d be happy to hear them.

-Doug

This is certainly new. The Bio-Formats writer seems to be loading that serialization class when it attempts to open the first OME-TIFF file for writing. Some questions:
- Are you saving the images anywhere unusual (i.e. a network drive), as opposed to a local disk?
- Have you updated Bio-Formats on the new machine? Are you using the daily build or the release version?
- Do you have other update sites enabled that might also be using this library?
- Does the following file exist: <OpenSPIM.app>/jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar?
Please make sure your installation is totally up to do date (have a look at the Fiji FAQ[1] to be completely sure).


> The Log is attached.


Would it be possible to get a more complete log file, i.e. one of the CoreLogYYYYMMDD files from the application directory? It's possible there are details near the start of the program that could shed some light on this.


Thanks!
Luke


[1] http://fiji.sc/FAQ#How_can_I_verify_that_my_Fiji_is_really_100.25_up_to_date.3F contains an in-depth guide to making sure every file is up to date.

On OS X and Linux, the GPhoto device adapter can drive at least some
Nikon cameras. On Windows (32-bit only), the NKRemoteCamera adapter
works with some Nikon DSLRs, although it depends on a commercial
library. However, I have not tried either of these adapters, and I don't
know if either will work (both theoretically and practically) with the
Nikon 1.

Best,
Mark

Dear Douglas,

This is what we do as well. Its not perfect, but it works. I guess we should document it on the wiki, but better Fiji then OpenSPIM since this is a LZ1 specific issue.

I have something like that here, but it deals exclusively with headless operation on a cluster http://fiji.sc/SPIM_Registration_on_cluster

Sending data to bioformats is a great idea, they are working on it.

All the best

PAvel

As long as your system has enough RAM, you can open individual, or all views, and then convert to .tif using Fiji.  If any of the views exceed your RAM, you will have to open them as a virtual stack, convert to .tif and downsample before running the registration/fusion plugins.

Hi all,

It turns out using the advanced mode updater as described in the FIJI FAQ did the trick. Everything seems to be working normally now and the asynchronous write-to-disk works as expected. We must have had something out of date in the Bio-Formats writer.

Thanks for your help,

damian

This is certainly new. The Bio-Formats writer seems to be loading that serialization class when it attempts to open the first OME-TIFF file for writing. Some questions:
- Are you saving the images anywhere unusual (i.e. a network drive), as opposed to a local disk?
- Have you updated Bio-Formats on the new machine? Are you using the daily build or the release version?
- Do you have other update sites enabled that might also be using this library?
- Does the following file exist: <OpenSPIM.app>/jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar?
Please make sure your installation is totally up to do date (have a look at the Fiji FAQ[1] to be completely sure).


> The Log is attached.


Would it be possible to get a more complete log file, i.e. one of the CoreLogYYYYMMDD files from the application directory? It's possible there are details near the start of the program that could shed some light on this.


Thanks!
Luke


[1] http://fiji.sc/FAQ#How_can_I_verify_that_my_Fiji_is_really_100.25_up_to_date.3F contains an in-depth guide to making sure every file is up to date.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] T-spim
Message-ID: <1C4F27D9-EAB9-42AE-A151-2FBB4485BFAB@hci.utah.edu>

For those who have built a T-SPIM, I have a several questions. The first question is about creating the second illumination light sheet.  The T-SPIM drawing in the OPENSPIM gallery, a mirror is placed near the laser that splits the light between two identical light paths each complete with cylindrical lenses etc.. My question is rather than creating two identical light paths with many optical components, why can't a the light sheet be created in a single light path and a splitting mirror be placed at the end prior to the 10x Olympus dipping lens and routed with mirrors to the back of the other 10x dipping lens.  The second question concerns shuttering the laser. Does anyone have any  shutters that they would recommend for use with a T-SPIM? Finally, does anyone have a digital plans for a T-SPIM sample chamber?

thanks

Michael Redd

Hello Christian,

 

Sorry about your troubles with Micromanager.

I have no experience with this software.

But, I am hoping one of the people on the CC list (above) will respond to
your email soon.

They are the people that have developed the software to bridge Micromanager
to our software DLL that controls the 4D-Stage.

Let me know if you are still having problems, I can contact them directly
for you.

Thanks

Are you able to run the Stage with our Windows application for testing?

If so, then the DLL files must be there (somewhere), the application uses
them. 

 

If you have any question with using Micro Manager, I encourage you to ask
the micromanager list (at
<https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community>
https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager%20Community) with any
questions as well. I've cced our collaborator Nico Stuurman who is lead of
the micromanager project and one of the lead programmers Mark Tsuchida. I
know they would like to address any questions or concerns you might have.

 

As for my French, I grew-up with French speaking parents (from Quebec) so I
did learn to speak French.

But I was born in the States (Vermont) and went to English schools.

There is very little opportunity to speak French here, except with family. 

I would need to move to Quebec (or France) to regain my full use of my
original language.

If I did, I am sure it would come back quickly.

Thanks (Merci)

Hello John,

I am trying to install the 4D stage under Micro Manager software. (I am
involved in the project with F . Brau  that order the stage)
Reading the instruction under the installation of that device into the
MManager website https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/PicardStage
(here is a copy :

PicardStage 


Summary:

Picard Industries USB Slide I/II and USB Twister


Author:

Johannes Schindelin and Luke Stuyvenberg


License:

Platforms:

Windows


Installation 


Download the USB 4D stage software
<http://www.picard-industries.com/products.html#usb-4d-stage>  from Picard.
Run the installer, and also copy the file 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\Win32\PiUsb.dll (for 32-bit Micro-Manager) or 4D-Stage DLL and
Docs\x64\PiUsb.dll (for 64-bit Micro-Manager) into your Micro-Manager
folder.


But unfortunatly I do not find the 4D-stage DLL in the package that I
download from your site. Could you help in in that purpose ?

Merci (are you speaking  French ?)


Christian Rouviere

Dear Christian,

Yes, we routinely use and works fine. When you install the driver, you are saying Micromanager won't see? Luke can you help?

Hi Christian,

1) Make sure you are using a recent nightly build of Micro-Manager
(the Picard device adapter has been in the OpenSPIM project for a
while but was added to the official Micro-Manager project just _after_
the 1.4.17 release).

https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Nightly_Builds

2) You do not need to copy the Picard DLLs (they are included in the
Micro-Manager installer) if you use a nightly build since 20140519.

Best,
Mark

Hi Ke,

first of all: welcome to the OpenSPIM community! It is an exciting project
and it is good that so many people start building their own SPIM setups
and start sharing their experiences.

Especially in this light, though, I'd like to point out I do not discuss
Open Source (or, as in this case, Open Hardware) in private mails (unless
I am paid for it specifically, and I would charge what my work is truly
worth). Therefore, I Cc:ed the OpenSPIM mailing list and encourage you to
reply-to-all.

Hmm... Typically, this means that the serial number is wrong... You should
be able to set it in the properties in the wizard.

That is valuable information, thanks for sharing. I half suspected the
cable to be faulty.

Well, I hope that the above comment helps you solve the problem!

Has anyone built a T-SPIM system? It seems like a good idea on paper.  Are there good reasons not to build a T-SPIM?

Thanks

Hello Michael,

Yes, we have. I have designs for the Olympus line of water dipping objectives and for a mixture of Olympus illumination objectives and the Nikon 16x/0.8. Carsten Wolff has this setup in Berlin.

I can get you plans for either or both in the very near future. 

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Johannes,

Thanks so much for answering my question!

I tried your suggestion. While the problem is that I can't add the Z stage
in the wizard so I have no access to the properties and can't change the
serial number of the Z stage. (I can change the serial numbers of XY stage
after I add them.)

I have tried different cables and the problem still exists.

What other potential reasons can cause this problem? Is there any way to
solve the problem? Do you think generate a problem report helps?

Thanks,
Ke

Hi Mark,

I'm Ke, the graduate student asked you questions related to the USB 4D
stage of Picard Industry about three weeks ago. Thanks for answering my
questions before. Now I encounter some problems.

1. I still can't add the Z stage when I create the hardware configuration.
I tried both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows system, neither can work. Since the
problem report doesn't give much info, I'm not sure whether there are other
ways to solve this problem? And what possible reasons can cause the
problem?

2. As for the steps of installing the OpenSPIM/Fiji package, I can't find
the *Micro-Manager* or *Micro-Manager studio* when I click the plugins in
the Micro-Manager (*Plugins->Micro-Manager->Micro-Manager Studio)* I'm
using in my windows 7 64-bit system, which is the newest version.
[image: Inline image 1]

3. And is the windows 7 64-bit system a potential problem for hardware
control since Window XP 32-bit is the required system? Can the Windows 7
64-bit system be the reason that I can't add the Z stage (But the XY stage
works well and I tried to add the stage in the 32-bit XP system, the Z
stage still can't be added)?

Thanks,
Ke

Are you sure you have the correct serial number for the Z stage (as
Johannes suggested)? In the problem report you sent us, it looked like
you had not set the serial number when adding the Z stage in the
Hardware Configuration Wizard. This causes the device adapter to use the
serial number "-1", which always results in an error.

Do you see a field to enter the serial number for the Z stage? If you cannot
get it to work even when entering the correct serial number, could you try
sending another Problem Report?

Here is the relevant section of the log you sent:

I'll let the OpenSPIM folks address these questions. For the Picard
stage specifically, there is no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work
on Windows 7 64 bit, but we have not tested the stage here.

Sorry, I hadn't seen your reply to Johannes that answered that question of mine.

I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected to the
computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization settings
(including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
configuration wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage,
but not the XY stage (at least on my computer).

Johannes, I also found the cause: OnSerialGeneric() is calling the
Initialize() function, which fails. This happens before the Hardware
Wizard calls Initialize (actually, when the wizard is trying to get
the initial values of the pre-init properties), so the wizard has no
chance to display the configuration dialog.

Simply taking out the calls to Initialize (PicardStage.cpp lines
243-245, 258) seems to fix this, but I'm not sure if that is all that
needs to be done (since I don't have a Picard stage and cannot figure
out what the intent of calling Initialize() at this point was).
Johannes, can you take a look at this?

Best,
Mark

The intent of the Initialize call was to test the serial number received from the Pi-detector, but I didn't account for the possibility of CPiDetector returning DEFAULT_SERIAL_UNKNOWN, which it does if the requested device hadn't been found. I'm preparing a fix for this that I will submit via SVN as soon as possible.


The ultimate issue is this: The Pi-detector only tested serial numbers up to 250. I've doubled this for now, but this is a stop-gap measure that causes an ugly pause in the device adding process while it probes the serial numbers; I will need to seek a different approach to detecting the motors.


I'll report back after fixing/testing and committing/uploading the device adapter.

Hi all (mainly to Ke),

Just a word from my experience using Win7/64bit. Ke - in order for Picard's
own application to work, you need to have the serial numbers for the XY, Z
and R components exactly right. I didn't receive any documentation on what
to do. I just copied the serial numbers that i saw in some simple
documentation that came with it... but using these never got the Picard
application to work. However, the OpenSPIM system worked fine. Anyway,
after having this for some months (and just putting down the Picard program
not working to some weird bug), I only realised today when the serial
number stickers on the 4d stage itself jumped out at me (which aren't
hidden, they're pretty obvious actually now that I look at them!). Anyway,
entering in *those* number, *ding* the Picard application worked, and I
could control the application from that piece of software. FWIW, our
serials were 198, 199, 200. R was much lower, 60-something. :)
What I've also found, is that the "home" position was never set correctly
until I managed to get the 4D stage to properly talk to its own software. X
and Y were extending far too much into the sample chamber. Now that we
could properly 'Home' the stage in its own software once, it's much better
now and we have much better range. :)

Other comments about Win7/6: In our hands the Fiji/ImageJ and the
Micromanager>OpenSpim plugin work fine. I launch it as a WindowsXP/32 bit
compatibility application and it seems to be happy so far. It didn't like
being opened natively. I also tried compiling a Win7/64 build from GIT, but
I never spent the time to properly work out how to roll the plugins for the
hardware into it, so on that basis it never worked properly. As for the
system itself, we still haven't actually captured anything yet as we've had
all sorts of fun getting the sample chamber right -- and we're just
aligning/calibrating it now. But the stage, camera, and laser are all
happily being controlled by the OpenSPIM micromanager plugin.

cheers,
Kieran

In that case, maybe you can remove the call to Initialize() from the
BeforeGet branch of OnGenericSerial() (if you insist that the serial
number must be checked immediately when the user enters it, instead of
when the OK button is clicked).

Best,

Hi Guys,

might I ask what the issue is with the OBIS that requires a clean up?  I 
guess I'm wrong in thinking that a diode laser would only emit one 
wavelength (or very small spectral bandwidth)?

Thanks
Neil

I guess this is valuable information for the FAQ on the OpenSPIM Wiki!

Yeah, I guess that the problem is that we only drive it as a 32-bit
application here, so we probably forgot to include the 64-bit drivers ;-)

Yeah, this is currently in flux. The Picard Stage driver adapter made it
into Micro-Manager proper, so we no longer have to compile the C++ part,
really, unless we improve or fix the adapter. But we did not yet have time
to reflect that in the Wiki.

Awesome! Feel free to add a photo of your setup to
http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F!

And I am curious: what were the problems with the sample chamber? It might
be useful information for the FAQ, too, to save other OpenSPIMmers some
time...

I am really happy to see more and more OpenSPIM systems cropping up, this
is exciting!

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello Niel,

The 488ish nm model emits a unmeasurable (with a meeter) amount of green
light that can still be seen due to our eye's spectral response... Use an
emission filter to block the laser and see what comes out of the other
side.

Pete

Hi everyone,

And so here I am. I've committed the changes to SVN and uploaded the 32-bit version of the DLL to the OpenSPIM update site.


Mark -- Following your suggestion, those lines were removed -- in hindsight, it's not really the correct behavior, and the possible issue with obtaining an invalid serial number shouldn't be common at all. Thanks!


Kieran -- I recently became aware of the homing problem; the stage sometimes resets its internal location (when it loses power, perhaps?), so over time it will be pushed away. The X/Y stage can be homed using the MM Script Panel, running mmc.home("Picard XY Stage") -- the Z stage has no appropriate API call, so for the time being, there is a property "GoHome" that will home that stage when set to 1. It's a workaround until I can submit a more useful patch to the MM team (though, as an API change, that may take a little while).


Ke -- Please let me know if there are any more problems; hope this helps!


Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much. Could you please send the link of the changed version to
me? And since my system is 64-bit, how can I solve the Z stage problem (no
field to change the serial number since I can't add the Z stage first)?

Thanks,
Ke

Hi Ke,

You still can add the seral number to the Z in the Picard
application/program. This is totally independent of micromanager.

The other thing is, the 4D stage axes are labeled with stickers which have
2 bits of info . 1st is stage name and the other is the serial number. The
stage name doesn't necessarily represent what you think it does. Our "Z"
actually translates the stage toward and away from the detection objective!
That doesn't really matter though, I see Z as just a name that doesn't
truly reflect its function. It still works fine.

Once you enter in the correct serial number in the Picard application the
indicators for the stage communication in the software should turn from red
to green.

The picard software is*very* strict about this serial number setting. I
could use just about any numbers and micromanager worked -- but this really
wont.
My feeling is that if you at least have picards app working you will know
if its a "driver" problem or not.

It'll make Luke's job a lot easier if this is done. Have you already done
this and is there communication between the 4d stage and its own software
once you have entered tge correct serial numbers?

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

Thanks for your detailed info. The 4D stage can be controlled normally by
the software from Picard in my system. While I just can't add the Z stage
when I try to create the hardware configuration wizard by micro-manager. So
there is no place I can put the serial number of the Z stage in. (I can add
XY stage and the twister normally and change -1 into the correct serial
number of the XY stage).

I can also reproduce the problem exactly as what Mark did and encountered
(From Mark: I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected
to the computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization
settings (including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
configuration
wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage, but not the XY stage
(at least on my computer).)

Thanks,
Ke

Hello,
I am afraid that after updating to the newest PicardStage dll, my previous
configuration is unable to load the stage.  I get an error message:

Line 8: Device,Picard Twister,PicardStage,Picard Twister
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 9: Device,Picard Z Stage,PicardStage,Picard Z Stage
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 10: Device,Picard XY Stage,PicardStage,Picard XY Stage
Failed to load device adapter "PicardStage" from
"C:\Users\ah659\Desktop\OPENSP~1\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll"

Line 22: Property,Picard Twister,Serial Number,60

Line 23: Property,Picard Z Stage,Serial Number,181

Line 28: Property,Picard XY Stage,Y-Max,8000

Line 29: Property,Picard XY Stage,Y-Min,1
No device with label "Picard XY Stage"

Line 44: Property,Core,Focus,Picard Z Stage
Cannot set Core property Focus to invalid value "Picard Z Stage"

I can still load the camera and my shutter.  The Picard Stage now appears
unavailable in the hardware configuration wizard.  I am also using 32-bit
Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven't had trouble loading the stage before
(it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional
communication delay that I mentioned earlier).  I attach a core log.

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about that; it seems a lot more had changed than I had expected. I've updated the update site again, with a number of changes (new MMCore, new versions of the device adapters). It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there's still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.


Thanks!
Luke

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier). I attach a core log.

Hi Michael,

creating two separate light sheets has a couple of advantages. You are more flexible in setting up the system, and you can compensate better for potential deviations due to differences in lenses etc. I fear that creating a single light sheet and splitting it afterwards can be difficult to set up and align, because you have to consider the length of your optical paths. And the required additional splitters and mirrors potentially introduce aberrations.

I just picked the shutter in the T-SPIM concept because they are small and there was a 3D model available… but I believe people already built T-SPIM, right?! Using a 50/50 splitter and two AOTF/AOM (or two diode lasers) is another option.

Modifying the chamber for more than two lenses is straight forward, I think Pete already has a 3D model for that?!

Best,
Michael

The T-SPIM drawing in the OPENSPIM gallery, a mirror is placed near the laser that splits the light between two identical light paths each complete with cylindrical lenses etc.. My question is rather than creating two identical light paths with many optical components, why can't a the light sheet be created in a single light path and a splitting mirror be placed at the end prior to the 10x Olympus dipping lens and routed with mirrors to the back of the other 10x dipping lens.  The second question concerns shuttering the laser. Does anyone have any  shutters that they would recommend for use with a T-SPIM? Finally, does anyone have a digital plans for a T-SPIM sample chamber?

Hi Luke,

Thank you!  I am still having a problem, probably because I'm using a
nonstandard setup.  There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a
PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I
try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in
use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I
load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3."  The
shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don't run into this
conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24
June.  I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.
The Picard stage now appears in the list of available hardware, but when I
try to load all three the computer bluescreens.

Thanks again,
Aurelia

If you're using the usual OpenSPIM installation from our website, you may also be able to obtain the changes by running the ImageJ Updater (Help -> Update...) -- however, some issues with this update have been reported, and I'm still working on resolving them; though updating may fix the problem you are encountering, it may cause some others. I'll do my best to keep the mailing list up-to-date on my progress.


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Aurelia,

> Thank you! I am still having a problem, probably because I&#39;m using a nonstandard setup. There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.



Do the devices work individually in OpenSPIM? i.e. if only one is loaded, do you ever get that message? It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn't updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I'll also be looking into this.

Load all three devices (camera, shutter, stage), or load all three stages? Does it bluescreen reliably? (I've not seen/heard of this happening before...)


I'll let you know what I work out. Thanks again!
Luke

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier).

With the SerialManager dll from June 24, I get the same error messages but

Thanks again!

Hi Aurelia,

Could you attach your configuration file, and report your system specs (OS version/architecture) as well? The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I'm still not entirely certain what's going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren't correct, they probably wouldn't load at all, so presumably you've already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)


Thanks,
Luke

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.

I am also using 32-bit Fiji on a 64-bit machine, but haven&#39;t had trouble loading the stage before (it appeared to work normally, with the exception of the occasional communication delay that I mentioned earlier). I attach a core log.

Hi,

One further thought -- the Java error at the top of the log file comes from a conflict in rsyntaxtextarea.jar (some e-mails on the MM mailing list discuss this issue, and we're working on porting Fiji/IJ2 to a newer version of the jar) -- I expected that having these in conflict would only disable the Micro-Manager script editor, but some testing suggests it might be more disruptive than that. Another fix you can try without waiting on me: From vanilla MM, copy: "plugins/Micro-Manager/rsyntaxtextarea.jar" -> (in OpenSPIM.app) "jars/rsyntaxtextarea.jar"; then, move, rename, or delete "jars/rsyntaxtextarea-2.0.4.1.jar".


Thanks again,
Luke

The core log certainly seems to suggest it is attempting to load COM3 multiple times (it also seems to reset the serial port properties with each stage loaded from PicardStage), but short of that, I'm still not entirely certain what's going on. If the 24 June device adapters weren't correct, they probably wouldn't load at all, so presumably you've already copied all the right DLLs. (SerialManager and ThorlabsSC10 are self-contained, so just those files should be enough to run those devices; PVCAM has an external DLL, but your core log suggests the camera initializes without a problem.)

There seems to be a conflict in loading my camera (a PVCam one) and the shutter I use to block the laser (Thorlabs SC10); when I try to configure, I get a message "the specified label COM3 is already in use" before anything has been configured, and then several times after I load both, one that says "Line8: device, COM3, serialmanager, COM3." The shutter should be on COM3 but not the camera, and I don&#39;t run into this conflict when I load both shutter and camera in the vanilla MM from 24 June. I attach a core log showing an attempt to load shutter and camera.

It sounds like a problem with the SerialManager, a device adapter which I hadn&#39;t updated -- you might try pulling mmgr_dal_SerialManager.dll from the 24 June nightly build. I&#39;ll also be looking into this.

It tested okay on my virtual machine, but if there&#39;s still a problem, please let me know. If you run into other device adapter problems (i.e. not with PicardStage), try getting updated device adapter versions from the nightly build as of 24 June or so.
