Subject: [OpenSPIM] Short downtime of the OpenSPIM wiki
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1410011841570.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Dear OpenSPIM community,

between 1pm and 2pm CDT (corresponding to 7pm ro 8pm UTC), there will be a
short downtime of the servers hosting the OpenSPIM wiki and mailing list.
It should not last longer than 10 minutes.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] sample holder
Message-ID: <D0547DE4.13924%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I have questions about the Openspim stage sample holder. From the JOVE description and the Openspim website, I believe that zebrafish samples are mounted in FEP tubing and suspended in front of the imaging lens using a 1mL syringe (with a blunt needle sticking into the FEP tubing) that is stuck through the Picard stage pulley wheel and suspended with some kind of rubber stopper to adjust the sample height with the imaging lens. The pulley wheel on my Picard stage that holds the syringe does not fit my BD sciences 1mL syringes tightly. The syringe has a lot of side to side play which doesn't seem like a good idea. Are there 1mL syringes from other manufacturers that fit this pulley wheel more tightly? Any suggestions would be welcome.

Cheers
mike

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Z motor problem
Message-ID: <D0547E00.13927%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

Hi Johannes,
I am still unable to communicate with the Picard Z motor in fiji running on windows xp 32. I tried a windows 7 machine and fiji communicates fine with my Picard Z motor. Unfortunately, my Stradus laser doesn't work on the Windows 7 machine. I put the stradus driver in the main folder of fiji and the stradus laser is listed as unavailable on the device list in the configuration wizard. This driver placement worked fine with fiji in XP 32.  Any advice?

Thanks
mike

I have been struggling with fiji failing to communicate with my Picard Z-motor. ImageJ and micromanager can drive the stage just fine. I managed to get fiji to communicate with my Picard Z motor by replacing the openspim fiji mm Picard stage driver with the Picard driver from micromanager 1.4 in a windows 7 machine. (This does not work with windows xp 32.) Unfortunately I now get another error: "Line 8: Device COM1, Serial Manager, COM1 The specified label "COM1" is already in use". Can anyone help me? Here is a core log

Hi Michael,

The error suggests that the configuration file is trying to load the 
COM1 device twice.

Do you have multiple serial devices in the configuration? The log seems 
to suggest not. Have you tried creating a configuration from scratch? 
It's possible there have been changes to SerialManager that require 
creating a new configuration file.

If these ideas don't help, could you please send an e-mail to the list 
containing your configuration file and the core log as attachments?

Thanks!
Luke

Message-ID: <002b01cfe70b$16956620$43c03260$@wisc.edu>

Hi Michael,

 

We are currently using a syringe and plunger system as our SPIM sample
holder.  This works great for fixed samples, but are now moving into some
live imaging.  We have some FEP tubing for mounting the samples and were
noticing that in the JOVE article and on the OpenSPIM website that you have
a metal sample holder for the tubing.  Would you be willing to share details
on the design of that holder: dimensions, parts, a drawing or anything else
that might help us recreate that holder? 

 

Thanks,

 

Julie

Hi Julie,


we bought the metal sample from Zeiss, it?s the same as in the Lightsheet Z.1. We had other holders before, but this one is definitely a worthy upgrade. It?s made from stainless steel and uses magnets to snap into place.


Best,

Michael

Thanks for the reply. It worked. I was finally able to open the Spim   acquisition plugin and take images with the microscope. I am running Fiji on a Windows 7 32 bit machine with the Stradus laser. I still have an issue. The Stradus laser power cannot be modulated by the Spim acquisition window. The laser power slider doesn't do anything. Any advice?

Cheers

Oh, Yes. we solved the problem, as the suggestion http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-May/000408.html

Since the Stradus device adapter is "secret", my ability to help is limited.
My suggestion is:
- First, please make sure you are using the Stradus device adapter
(mmgr_dal_Stradus.dll) from the 5 February 2014 nightly build of
Micro-Manager[1].
- Run OpenSPIM, but before clicking "Acquire SPIM Image", create a pixel
size:
- On Micro-Manager, click "Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration..."
- Click "New"
- Set Label to "Uncalibrated"
- Set Pixel Size (um/pixel) to 1.00
- Across from "Core - Initialize" click "Use" checkbox.
- Click "OK".
- Try "Acquire SPIM Image" again.

We have been trying to run deconvolution on a cluster at the NIH without much luck.  Although we have run the process on a 256GB node and Fiji says the deconvolution should only take ~80GB, Fiji still crashes.  How accurate are these memory estimates?  Is it possible that we are still running out of memory?  Or is it more likely that our settings just aren't right?  Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Dear Graham,

Are you using GPU acceleration? Is there any error message? How big is the image you are trying to deconvolve?

It may be advisable to use blocks instead of the deconvolving the entire image at once, but at this point its just a hunch.

I am cc'ing Stephan Preibisch who should be able to help, but we need more information.

All the best

Hi All,

when I click "Acquire SPIM Image" in /plugins in Micromanager the SPIM 
window no longer opens.
Last week everything still worked fine and I did not (at least not 
consciously) change anything. I still can access all devices in MM, 
every seems to work. I pulled out an old backup of the entire Fiji 
folder with the same result.
Any ideas are highly appreciated!

Best,

Robert

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1410011841570.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Dear OpenSPIM community,

between 1pm and 2pm CDT (corresponding to 7pm ro 8pm UTC), there will be a
short downtime of the servers hosting the OpenSPIM wiki and mailing list.
It should not last longer than 10 minutes.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] sample holder
Message-ID: <D0547DE4.13924%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I have questions about the Openspim stage sample holder. From the JOVE description and the Openspim website, I believe that zebrafish samples are mounted in FEP tubing and suspended in front of the imaging lens using a 1mL syringe (with a blunt needle sticking into the FEP tubing) that is stuck through the Picard stage pulley wheel and suspended with some kind of rubber stopper to adjust the sample height with the imaging lens. The pulley wheel on my Picard stage that holds the syringe does not fit my BD sciences 1mL syringes tightly. The syringe has a lot of side to side play which doesn't seem like a good idea. Are there 1mL syringes from other manufacturers that fit this pulley wheel more tightly? Any suggestions would be welcome.

Cheers
mike

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Z motor problem
Message-ID: <D0547E00.13927%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

Hi Johannes,
I am still unable to communicate with the Picard Z motor in fiji running on windows xp 32. I tried a windows 7 machine and fiji communicates fine with my Picard Z motor. Unfortunately, my Stradus laser doesn't work on the Windows 7 machine. I put the stradus driver in the main folder of fiji and the stradus laser is listed as unavailable on the device list in the configuration wizard. This driver placement worked fine with fiji in XP 32.  Any advice?

Thanks
mike

I have been struggling with fiji failing to communicate with my Picard Z-motor. ImageJ and micromanager can drive the stage just fine. I managed to get fiji to communicate with my Picard Z motor by replacing the openspim fiji mm Picard stage driver with the Picard driver from micromanager 1.4 in a windows 7 machine. (This does not work with windows xp 32.) Unfortunately I now get another error: "Line 8: Device COM1, Serial Manager, COM1 The specified label "COM1" is already in use". Can anyone help me? Here is a core log

Hi Michael,

The error suggests that the configuration file is trying to load the 
COM1 device twice.

Do you have multiple serial devices in the configuration? The log seems 
to suggest not. Have you tried creating a configuration from scratch? 
It's possible there have been changes to SerialManager that require 
creating a new configuration file.

If these ideas don't help, could you please send an e-mail to the list 
containing your configuration file and the core log as attachments?

Thanks!
Luke

Message-ID: <002b01cfe70b$16956620$43c03260$@wisc.edu>

Hi Michael,

 

We are currently using a syringe and plunger system as our SPIM sample
holder.  This works great for fixed samples, but are now moving into some
live imaging.  We have some FEP tubing for mounting the samples and were
noticing that in the JOVE article and on the OpenSPIM website that you have
a metal sample holder for the tubing.  Would you be willing to share details
on the design of that holder: dimensions, parts, a drawing or anything else
that might help us recreate that holder? 

 

Thanks,

 

Julie

Hi Julie,


we bought the metal sample from Zeiss, it’s the same as in the Lightsheet Z.1. We had other holders before, but this one is definitely a worthy upgrade. It’s made from stainless steel and uses magnets to snap into place.


Best,

Michael

Thanks for the reply. It worked. I was finally able to open the Spim   acquisition plugin and take images with the microscope. I am running Fiji on a Windows 7 32 bit machine with the Stradus laser. I still have an issue. The Stradus laser power cannot be modulated by the Spim acquisition window. The laser power slider doesn't do anything. Any advice?

Cheers

Oh, Yes. we solved the problem, as the suggestion http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-May/000408.html

Since the Stradus device adapter is "secret", my ability to help is limited.
My suggestion is:
- First, please make sure you are using the Stradus device adapter
(mmgr_dal_Stradus.dll) from the 5 February 2014 nightly build of
Micro-Manager[1].
- Run OpenSPIM, but before clicking "Acquire SPIM Image", create a pixel
size:
- On Micro-Manager, click "Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration..."
- Click "New"
- Set Label to "Uncalibrated"
- Set Pixel Size (um/pixel) to 1.00
- Across from "Core - Initialize" click "Use" checkbox.
- Click "OK".
- Try "Acquire SPIM Image" again.

We have been trying to run deconvolution on a cluster at the NIH without much luck.  Although we have run the process on a 256GB node and Fiji says the deconvolution should only take ~80GB, Fiji still crashes.  How accurate are these memory estimates?  Is it possible that we are still running out of memory?  Or is it more likely that our settings just aren't right?  Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Dear Graham,

Are you using GPU acceleration? Is there any error message? How big is the image you are trying to deconvolve?

It may be advisable to use blocks instead of the deconvolving the entire image at once, but at this point its just a hunch.

I am cc'ing Stephan Preibisch who should be able to help, but we need more information.

All the best

Hi All,

when I click "Acquire SPIM Image" in /plugins in Micromanager the SPIM 
window no longer opens.
Last week everything still worked fine and I did not (at least not 
consciously) change anything. I still can access all devices in MM, 
every seems to work. I pulled out an old backup of the entire Fiji 
folder with the same result.
Any ideas are highly appreciated!

Best,

Robert
