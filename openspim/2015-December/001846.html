<PRE>Hi all, I hope the science is treating you well.

I have been looking at getting started with getting into the code, which I see is here:
<A HREF="http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/">http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/</A>
but I'm a little lost about how to get started, and how to be part of the open source effort vs. just making my own version.

I'm a semi experienced programmer (a little Java, Pascal, C, Matlab, Igor Pro, LabView, NIDAQ to varying levels) and I have all the applications in place (Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio Express 2010, 2015, and all the java SDKs I might need).  Where I get lost is how to incorporate anything I do into the existing code?  What parts should I, can I work on?  Do these changes need to be vetted before being incorporated?  How do I get started with version control?  Etc. etc.  I feel this is, for me, the biggest hurdle in open source coding:  Not being able to code, but being able to 'open source'.  I've always been a lone coder up until this point, so please excuse my ignorance to these details.

Also, I think maybe I'm stuck on the Maven thing.  I see in the README.md that it's Maven, drawing on SciJava, and I can import into Netbeans for example.  Does anybody have any good links to help me get started with that?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil
