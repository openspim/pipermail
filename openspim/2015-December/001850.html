<PRE>Hi guys,

I've gotten the following installed on the microscope controller PC (fresh Win7 64bit install):
- Netbeans 8.1
- JDK 1.7.0_80 (unchecking the open JRE option, assuming that my JRE 1.8.0_66 is all I need for my browser) (I've installed both 32 and 64 bit versions of both).
-  OpenSPIM-20150427 extracted

I created a GIT account, watched a few tutorials and have the gist for now - I'll come back to that once I get to understanding where I'm going to start making changes.  I downloaded a clone, Maven appeared to download all the required files when I clicked Resolve Issues (initially shows as [unloadable]).  When I Clean and Build it looks to build ok.  When I try to Run it gives the following exception:

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bsh/EvalError
at spim.SPIMAcquisition.main(SPIMAcquisition.java:1587)

I've attached the full output window with -e and -X settings in place (sorry if too verbose, I can provide other details if needed).

I thought there might be changes in the master repo, so I performed a pull, and on inspecting the differences it appears some changes has been made, but still I get the same error on running the code.  That's assuming I have incorporated those changes.  Does a pull automatically merge with my original clone?
I'm using the git options via Netbeans.

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil
