Subject: [OpenSPIM] laser for openSPIM
Message-ID: <CAKWGfdLFBD0pZ3sk5q1UHiS52W=6twhBusw1R+y4cf9-rasrMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello
The laser parts listed in openSPIM are expensive (7000 euros).
Is there a way to get cheaper lasers work  ?
I've been trying to make a very small focus point with a cheap red laser
diode without success. I often see several points instead of one. And I
cant make the point(s) smaller than 0.1 mm .
But I dont know if it's because of the cheap lenses I use, or the aperture
that is too big, or the diode itself (transverse mode pattern ?).
So, what are the bare requirements for the laser in order to make it focus
to a size of about 10 um ?

Thanks for your help

Hi, Emmanuel,

As far as I know, diode lasers always give a beam elongated in one axis. 
I would consider coupling a diode laser to a single-mode fiber, this 
will clean up all other modes except Gaussian (TEM_00). The output of 
the fiber can be collimated into a high-quality beam using an 
off-the-shelf collimator (Thorlabs sells them, for example).

I hope this helps,

Nikita

You can find cheaper lasers with good beam quality, but if you have a  
laser which can't be controlled from uManager, your sample will be  
illuminated all the time, also during moving or timelapse waiting periods.  
For some samples this will be a problem.

However, if that's acceptable for you, in the first version of my setup I  
was able to make a cheap diode laser work by focusing it onto a small  
pinhole. It's a similar solution to the fiber one, but somewhat cheaper.  
However, whether you use pinhole or fiber, you'll need a very precise XY  
positioner for effective coupling which is also not cheap (I was using a  
borrowed one).

Monika Pawłowska

Hi,

My laboratory is very new to lightsheet microscopy and one the doctoral
students in the lab recently built an openspim scope. She followed the
specs on the Wiki page with little or no modification. Our hardware works
fine, but as we are new to this we could use some help with the next steps
(e.g. making sure its aligned, establishing a consistent workflow, etc).
Please contact me directly, if you are interested in working with us to
launch the scope.

All the best,
Kevin Jones
