Subject: [OpenSPIM] which C-mount adapter
Message-ID: <0947c5ae3fcb84f0f85cf96857c4d46c@cam.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I wanted to ask why there is a choice of two different C-mount adapters, 
one is 1x and the other 0.5x magnifying?

Does this have anything to do with matching the microscope resolution 
with the pixel size of the used camera?

Or is the 0.5x magnifying one used to increase the field of view?

Thanks a lot.

Best wishes,
Stephanie

The 0.5x will increase the FOV.

To maximise your resolution without having "empty magnification" you 
would need to ensure that for a single PSF you have roughly 4 square 
pixels to image it with. Anything less and you will be under sampling 
your image, too many more and you'll be distributing unnecessary shot 
noise into your image.

For the magnifications and NAs that the openSPIM uses the nyquist 
criterion is likely never reached or even needed.

Dear Stephanie

The Olympus lenses have a field number of 26.5 mm. This is the diameter of the (circular) image that you get after the tubelens and that you try to capture with your camera. It thereby defines the maximally achievable field of view, e.g. for a 10x lens it is 26.5/10 = 2.65mm. If your camera chip, however, is smaller, then you will not capture the full field of view. For example a Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera has a diagonal of 21.8mm, which is pretty big but not big enough. The 0.5x adapter will demagnify the image to 26.5/2=13.25mm. It is specifically designed for 1/2in CCD chips since these have a diagonal of 25.4/2=12.7mm, which fits well into the smaller image. It is important to understand that the adapter does not increase the field of view; it only makes the image smaller and adapts it to your chip. You cannot use the 0.5x adapter with an sCMOS camera, e.g. to get twice the field of view.

Hope this helps
Jan

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Alignment of light sheet
Message-ID: <CAGv7iOjDuqO-u0CWUrP+pN5ooz6PKor5iTHej1mcYWD2PfPObQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OpenSPIM members,

I was wondering how other members performed the alignment of the light
sheet.

The wiki suggests the use of a portion of the Edmund Optics Multi-Grid test
grid glued to a syringe with a small mirror. However, there are not many
details regarding the making of this test grid/mirror syringe part so I
have been having some trouble with the alignment.

This method seems to require cutting out the grid from the EO part, which
from the images seems to be metal. Also, can this grid/mirror syringe setup
be reused or do we need to use a new grid every time the sheet needs to be
aligned? Have others experienced any trouble with this or do you have any
tips/suggestions?

Thank you,
Kathleen Chen

Hello Kathleen,

attached is an image of the tools that you can use for alignment: left a 
homebuild version (without grids), right a professional version 
(unfortunately not for sale).

The Edmund Multi-Grid test is based on a standard glass coverslip; the 
patterns are a very thin metal coating. You can cut the glass coverslip 
with a diamond pen, but getting the small pieces you need is somewhat 
tricky. Apparently it works better when you first make all the cuts 
needed, then break the coverslip.

The test target can be reused. Ideally, just use distilled water in your 
chamber while aligning. If you need to use buffer, inspect the glue 
regularly to make sure it does not dissolve (may damage your objektives 
if it's in solution and then deposits on them) and rinse the test target 
afterwards.

Best, Wiebke

Dear All, 

I would also suggest that if you have access to a micro-fabrication or photolithography lab cutting the glass with a dicing saw (made to cut silicon or glass wafers) did a very nice job cutting the Edmund slide to size per Wiebke's instructions. 

We are also designing a more SPIM- and user-friendly alignment tool similar to the commercial version which we hope to produce at scale and make available to the community soon. 

Regards, 
Kurt
