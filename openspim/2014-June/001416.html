Sorry, I hadn't seen your reply to Johannes that answered that question of mine.

I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected to the
computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization settings
(including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
configuration wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage,
but not the XY stage (at least on my computer).

Johannes, I also found the cause: OnSerialGeneric() is calling the
Initialize() function, which fails. This happens before the Hardware
Wizard calls Initialize (actually, when the wizard is trying to get
the initial values of the pre-init properties), so the wizard has no
chance to display the configuration dialog.

Simply taking out the calls to Initialize (PicardStage.cpp lines
243-245, 258) seems to fix this, but I'm not sure if that is all that
needs to be done (since I don't have a Picard stage and cannot figure
out what the intent of calling Initialize() at this point was).
Johannes, can you take a look at this?

Best,
Mark
