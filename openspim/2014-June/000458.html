<PRE>Hi everyone,

</I>

And so here I am. I've committed the changes to SVN and uploaded the 32-bit version of the DLL to the OpenSPIM update site.


Mark -- Following your suggestion, those lines were removed -- in hindsight, it's not really the correct behavior, and the possible issue with obtaining an invalid serial number shouldn't be common at all. Thanks!


Kieran -- I recently became aware of the homing problem; the stage sometimes resets its internal location (when it loses power, perhaps?), so over time it will be pushed away. The X/Y stage can be homed using the MM Script Panel, running mmc.home(&quot;Picard XY Stage&quot;) -- the Z stage has no appropriate API call, so for the time being, there is a property &quot;GoHome&quot; that will home that stage when set to 1. It's a workaround until I can submit a more useful patch to the MM team (though, as an API change, that may take a little while).


Ke -- Please let me know if there are any more problems; hope this helps!


Luke

</I>&gt;<i> The ultimate issue is this: The Pi-detector only tested serial numbers up to 250. I've doubled this for now, but this is a stop-gap measure that causes an ugly pause in the device adding process while it probes the serial numbers; I will need to seek a different approach to detecting the motors.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; problem report doesn't give much info, I'm not sure whether there are other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; ways to solve this problem? And what possible reasons can cause the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Are you sure you have the correct serial number for the Z stage (as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Johannes suggested)? In the problem report you sent us, it looked like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you had not set the serial number when adding the Z stage in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hardware Configuration Wizard. This causes the device adapter to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; serial number &quot;-1&quot;, which always results in an error.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you see a field to enter the serial number for the Z stage? If you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get it to work even when entering the correct serial number, could you try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sending another Problem Report?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I hadn't seen your reply to Johannes that answered that question of mine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization settings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but not the XY stage (at least on my computer).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Johannes, I also found the cause: OnSerialGeneric() is calling the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Initialize() function, which fails. This happens before the Hardware
