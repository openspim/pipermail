<PRE>Hi Kieran,

I guess this is valuable information for the FAQ on the OpenSPIM Wiki!

&gt;<i> Other comments about Win7/6: In our hands the Fiji/ImageJ and the

</I>
Yeah, I guess that the problem is that we only drive it as a 32-bit
application here, so we probably forgot to include the 64-bit drivers ;-)

&gt;<i> I also tried compiling a Win7/64 build from GIT, but I never spent the
</I>&gt;<i> time to properly work out how to roll the plugins for the hardware into
</I>&gt;<i> it, so on that basis it never worked properly.
</I>
Yeah, this is currently in flux. The Picard Stage driver adapter made it
into Micro-Manager proper, so we no longer have to compile the C++ part,
really, unless we improve or fix the adapter. But we did not yet have time
to reflect that in the Wiki.

&gt;<i> As for the system itself, we still haven't actually captured anything
</I>&gt;<i> yet as we've had all sorts of fun getting the sample chamber right --
</I>&gt;<i> and we're just aligning/calibrating it now. But the stage, camera, and
</I>&gt;<i> laser are all happily being controlled by the OpenSPIM micromanager
</I>&gt;<i> plugin.
</I>
Awesome! Feel free to add a photo of your setup to
<A HREF="http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F!">http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F!</A>

And I am curious: what were the problems with the sample chamber? It might
be useful information for the FAQ, too, to save other OpenSPIMmers some
time...

I am really happy to see more and more OpenSPIM systems cropping up, this
is exciting!

Ciao,
Johannes
