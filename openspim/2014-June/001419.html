</I>


The intent of the Initialize call was to test the serial number received from the Pi-detector, but I didn't account for the possibility of CPiDetector returning DEFAULT_SERIAL_UNKNOWN, which it does if the requested device hadn't been found. I'm preparing a fix for this that I will submit via SVN as soon as possible.


The ultimate issue is this: The Pi-detector only tested serial numbers up to 250. I've doubled this for now, but this is a stop-gap measure that causes an ugly pause in the device adding process while it probes the serial numbers; I will need to seek a different approach to detecting the motors.


I'll report back after fixing/testing and committing/uploading the device adapter.


Luke

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure you have the correct serial number for the Z stage (as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you had not set the serial number when adding the Z stage in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hardware Configuration Wizard. This causes the device adapter to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serial number &quot;-1&quot;, which always results in an error.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you see a field to enter the serial number for the Z stage? If you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get it to work even when entering the correct serial number, could you try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sending another Problem Report?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I hadn't seen your reply to Johannes that answered that question of mine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can reproduce the problem: with no Picard hardware connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> computer, no configuration dialog for the pre-initialization settings
</I>&gt;<i> (including the serial number) is displayed in the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> configuration wizard. This is the case for the Twister and Z stage,
</I>&gt;<i> but not the XY stage (at least on my computer).
