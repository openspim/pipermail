Are you sure you have the correct serial number for the Z stage (as
Johannes suggested)? In the problem report you sent us, it looked like
you had not set the serial number when adding the Z stage in the
Hardware Configuration Wizard. This causes the device adapter to use the
serial number &quot;-1&quot;, which always results in an error.

Do you see a field to enter the serial number for the Z stage? If you cannot
get it to work even when entering the correct serial number, could you try
sending another Problem Report?

Here is the relevant section of the log you sent:

&gt;<i> 2. As for the steps of installing the OpenSPIM/Fiji package, I can't find
</I>&gt;<i> the *Micro-Manager* or *Micro-Manager studio* when I click the plugins in
</I>&gt;<i> the Micro-Manager (*Plugins-&gt;Micro-Manager-&gt;Micro-Manager Studio)* I'm
</I>&gt;<i> using in my windows 7 64-bit system, which is the newest version.
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Inline image 1]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. And is the windows 7 64-bit system a potential problem for hardware
</I>&gt;<i> control since Window XP 32-bit is the required system? Can the Windows 7
</I>&gt;<i> 64-bit system be the reason that I can't add the Z stage (But the XY stage
</I>&gt;<i> works well and I tried to add the stage in the 32-bit XP system, the Z
</I>&gt;<i> stage still can't be added)?
</I>
I'll let the OpenSPIM folks address these questions. For the Picard
stage specifically, there is no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work
on Windows 7 64 bit, but we have not tested the stage here.

Best,
Mark
