FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY 2015

G&#195;&#182;ttingen, Germany, March 29 - April 1, 2015

28th International Conference on 3D Image Processing in Microscopy
27th International Conference on Confocal Microscopy

Dear Colleagues,

Abstracts for oral and poster presentations can now be submitted
through the conference website: <A HREF="http://www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org">http://www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org</A> where
also the conference registration has opened and hotel information is
available.

Deadline for abstract submission: Wednesday, January 20, 2015

After the successful FOM2014 conference held in Sydney earlier this
year, it is a pleasure to announce FOM2015, the next Focus on
Microscopy conference. It will take place in the Lokhalle venue,
G&#195;&#182;ttingen, Germany, in the week before Easter from Sunday 29 March
&#226;&#128;&#147; Wednesday 1 April 2015. It will be the next in a series of unique
interdisciplinary meetings on advanced multi-dimensional light
microscopy and image processing.

For further details please visit the FOCUS ON MICROSCOPY website
www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org. There, in addition to general information,
the scientific program of the previous Sydney and other FOM
conferences can be found at the link &#226;&#128;&#156;Past conferences&#226;&#128;&#157;. From 2004
onwards together with links in the scientific program to one page PDF
abstracts of the contributions presented in that year. Please note
also the &quot;Search FOM database &quot; button for full searches over the
digital FOM archive over the years.

FOM2015 is the continuation of a yearly conference series, started in
1988 presenting the latest innovations and newest trends in optical
microscopy, and their application in biology, medicine, and the
material sciences.

Key topics are:

* Theory and practice of confocal and multiphoton-excitation
microscopy
* Super-resolution, nanoscopy imaging: from PSF engineering (4pi,
SIM, STED), fluorescent activation/quenching, stochastic/centroid
(PALM, STORM, GSDIM, SOFI and related techniques) to TIRF
* 3D and 4D live cell and tissue imaging
* Adaptive optics for microscopy
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Light sheet microscopy
* Advanced fluorescence imaging/spectroscopy: FRET, FRAP, FLIM, FCS
* New fluorescence probes, proteins, quantum dots, single molecule
imaging
* Coherent non-linear microscopies: SHG, THG, SFG, CARS.
* Developments in phase/interference microscopies
* Multi-dimensional fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy imaging
* Correlated light/electron microscopy
* Laser manipulation and tracking, photo-activation
* Bio- and nano-materials, biosensors
* OCT, endoscopy
* Fast acquisition, automated and high-content microscopy
* 3D image processing and visualization for multidimensional data

At the 2015 conference the topic &#226;&#128;&#156;Super-resolution techniques and
applications&#226;&#128;&#157; will receive special attention, this also in
connection with the recently awarded Nobel Prize in this field.

The conference series is in addition known for covering the rapid
development of advanced fluorescence labeling techniques for confocal
and multi-photon 3D imaging of -live- biological specimens.

Abstracts for contributions are invited and can already be submitted
through the website: www.FocusOnMicroscopy.org  where further
information on the present and previous FOM conferences can be found.

Important dates/deadlines:

Deadline for the submission of abstracts
January 20, 2015

Acceptance contributions/program on the web
February 10, 2015

Deadline for early registration
February 25, 2015
