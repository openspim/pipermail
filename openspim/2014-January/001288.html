<PRE>Hi Neil,

About the changes made to our OpenSPIM setup at Fraunhofer IPT, there are 
two main changes:

*The redesign of the sample arm of the 4D Stage so that a timing belt and 
timing pulleys can be used instead
of the round belt and pulleys included with the 4D Stage. This was done 
because a slip between the belt
and pulleys was identified causing inaccuracies when rotating the sample. 
I don't know if someone else had this issue, 

*The redesign of the sample chamber so that the temperature of the medium 
can be controlled. For doing that a 
PT100 special for liquids, TO220 resistors and a PID controller were 
employed. The sample chamber had to
be built out of stainless steel so that  corrosive effects due to the 
sample medium can be avoided.

I can provide you the drawings and the CAD files, also the part number and 
manufacturer of the components that
were used,  just let me organize the information accordingly.

I think that would make sense to make this information available through 
the OpenSPIM wiki so that eveyone can use it if interested. 
At the same time I could have a feedback about the changes I made and 
further improvements can be done to the design. What is 
the opinion of all?

Best regards,
Edgar
