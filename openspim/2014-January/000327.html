<PRE>Hi Luke,

I have not tested yet the temperature-controlled SPIM chamber for long periods of time, but of course, the idea of this modification is to improve the conditions of
the sample during long-term experiments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,
       
       On 1/29/2014 6:09 AM, <A HREF="http://openspim.org/mailman/listinfo/openspim">edgar.escobar.nieto at ipt.fraunhofer.de</A> wrote:
          *The redesign of the         sample arm of the         4D Stage so that a timing belt and timing pulleys can be used         instead       
       of the round belt and pulleys         included         with the 4D Stage. This was done because a slip between the belt       
       and pulleys was identified         causing inaccuracies         when rotating the sample. I don't know if someone else had this         issue,              
          I haven't noticed any trouble with belt slippage, but it's good to     know this may be a problem (and moreover that there is an excellent     solution available.)
     
     *The redesign of the         sample chamber         so that the temperature of the medium can be controlled. For         doing that         a        
       PT100 special for liquids, TO220         resistors         and a PID controller were employed. The sample chamber had to       
       be built out of stainless steel         so that         &#160;corrosive effects due to the sample medium can be avoided.       
          This is great stuff. Do you know off-hand if these devices are     stable over time? i.e. four hours, eight, twenty-four? I suspect     good temperature control may improve time-lapse recording     somewhat...
     
     I can provide you the         drawings and the         CAD files, also the part number and manufacturer of the         components that       
       were used, &#160;just let me organize         the information accordingly.       
       
       I think that would make sense to         make         this information available through the OpenSPIM wiki so that         eveyone can         use it if interested.        
       At the same time I could have a         feedback         about the changes I made and further improvements can be done to         the design.         What is        
       the opinion of all?     By all means! That's what the wiki is there for, after all.
     
     Thanks for sharing!
     Luke
