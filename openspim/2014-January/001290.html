<PRE>Hi Edgar,

</I>I haven't noticed any trouble with belt slippage, but it's good to know 
this may be a problem (and moreover that there is an excellent solution 
available.)

</I>This is great stuff. Do you know off-hand if these devices are stable 
over time? i.e. four hours, eight, twenty-four? I suspect good 
temperature control may improve time-lapse recording somewhat...

&gt;<i> I can provide you the drawings and the CAD files, also the part number 
</I>&gt;<i> and manufacturer of the components that
</I>&gt;<i> were used,  just let me organize the information accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that would make sense to make this information available 
</I>&gt;<i> through the OpenSPIM wiki so that eveyone can use it if interested.
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time I could have a feedback about the changes I made and 
</I>&gt;<i> further improvements can be done to the design. What is
</I>&gt;<i> the opinion of all?
</I>By all means! That's what the wiki is there for, after all.

Thanks for sharing!
Luke
