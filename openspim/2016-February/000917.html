<PRE>Hi all, I hope the scopes are treating you well.

I have a general question for all.  I haven't yet taken any data (almost everything is in place and nearly ready to roll), but I'm curious to know about the axis of rotation when rotating the sample to different views.

Maybe I'm over thinking this, or the effects of being off axis are smaller than I imagine, but I'm really curious to know how people are experiencing and counteracting this part of the acquisition.  In a perfect world my theta would rotate around an axis parallel to the y axis and the sample would be placed on the rotation axis.  I could then translate the axis into the center of my camera and z-stack and rotate from there.  In reality, I'm guessing here as you know, you'd have an axis of rotation that's tilted to some degree, and the sample would likely be off center.  This would lead to samples moving in an arc when rotating, and xyz translation required to bring the region of interest back into view on each rotation.

Any experiences or thoughts in this direction are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil
