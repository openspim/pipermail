<PRE>Hi HongKee, I hope the code is treating you well.

Sorry for the delay; I've been pulled in a couple of different directions recently, but have been coming back to the plugin code a little more now.  For completeness, I've cc'd the openspim list, and for reference our last conversation was part of a thread called &quot;Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF packages?&quot; that I hijacked at the start of the year.

Thanks for the details on SPIMTestDrive section of the code.  It's great to now have the option to step through and figure things out.  One thing that I'm not sure about is the location of the code that builds the GUI form.  In other code I see the option to show the design of the form in Netbeans, but I don't see that here.  Is the GUI programmatically created without IDE assistance?  If so, how hard would it be to pull that into a form design type file in Netbeans?  It really speeds up my understanding of the code if I can quickly reference the buttons and sliders etc. in the exploration and debug stages.

You had previously asked about my direction in the plugin, and a large part of it would be to make the interface more user friendly and graphical.  My setup will be part of our core facility and I hope to have researchers here using the software once things are up and rolling.  If the GUI it is more programmatic, could you point me to that structure/code/... and maybe I could start from there.

My second direction would be to add the option of different hardware to the plugin.  Would it be possible to bring some sort of modularity to the GUI, that draws from the MM hardware settings and available core options?  Alternatively, might it be easier to add to the multidimensional acquisition panel in MM by including a rotation section?  You could then call that panel from the SPIM Acquisition plugin.

Sorry for the my somewhat fragmented questions/suggestions.  I'm sure it'll make more sense once I get into the details, and I appreciate any pointers you can offer as I get started.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil
