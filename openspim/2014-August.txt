Dear EMBO course participants!

We are really excited to welcome you to the EMBO practical course about
light sheet microscopy!

In preparation for the course, we added a couple of pages to the OpenSPIM
wiki; the top-level entry is this page:

	http://openspim.org/EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy

Also, we subscribed you all to the OpenSPIM mailing list; this is the best
way to communicate OpenSPIM related topics, such as the mail you are
reading right now!

We also created accounts and user pages for all of you; please have a
look:

	http://openspim.org/EMBO_2014_Participants

You should have received a mail with an activation link by now; please
activate your account now unless you have already done so.

At this stage, I would like to ask you to find your user page and edit it
(if you have not edited any wiki yet and need help with this, please have
a look at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents and do not hesitate
to ask questions about it on the OpenSPIM mailing list:
openspim at openspim.org). Feel free to describe your EMBO course project on
your user page, and if you need to upload images to make it look awesome,
go for it!

On behalf of the EMBO course team,

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about the delay; I've just moved across the States, and ran into 
enormous trouble getting my internet connection established.

It's interesting to me that Y isn't affected -- I presume you've tried 
this same test with a slight Y correction? And how did you measure your 
pixel size/have you verified its accuracy? Is this same test repeatable? 
I've been working on a test to validate the behavior of the anti-drift, 
and while it's not yet advanced enough for me to be certain there's no 
software fault here, I haven't been able to obtain these dramatic jerks 
so far.

When anti-drift is on, the software produces a directory containing some 
images useful for debugging problems with it -- if it's not too large, 
could you compress and send those files? (If they're more than a few 
megabytes, you can probably send it directly to me to spare other users' 
inboxes.) They might also help identify any problems.

Hope these questions help shed some light on the issue,
Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks!  I'll send you the anti-drift debugging images in a moment.  I
measured pixel size by taking a picture of my calibration grid and counting
pixels per line.  I only vaguely verified its accuracy by checking that the
displacement of the embryo in the composite image I sent before was about
the same as the correction listed in the anti-drift log file, and since
they match approximately, I didn't look further.  I could use the "move a
bead with the stage" method to check this more carefully, but it seems to
be about right.
The test is very repeatable, and in the case of making a small correction
to either Y or Z the stage moves to the suggested location and then doesn't
move significantly afterwards.
Let me know if you think of some more helpful test I could do.  I'm not
certain that there isn't some hardware oddity causing this, but so far I
haven't figured out what it could be.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <dd7029c83d4a472a841d50a2b2cb83a6@nippu12.univ.yo.oulu.fi>

Dear all,


We've been scanning some mouse tissue test samples with our dual-side illumination OpenSPIM for a short while now, and we are very happy with the first results!


We have used the original software package downloaded from openspim.org without any updates, and it has been working fine. However, now after using the Fiji updater Picard USB-stage rotation angle coordinates are not right anymore. Changing angle from -180 deg to 180 deg rotates the sample holder only ~180 degrees, and rotation in general spins the sample much less than indicated by the slider. In addition, we can not access and modify old .cfg-files, so that it would be possible to change step size of the twister from 1.8 to 1, as it was discussed earlier: http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-July/000482.html . Modification of an existing configuration starts with an error "Error in device Picard Z Stage: Unable to communicate with the device" followed by lots of COM and "No device with label _device name_" -errors. Creating a new configuration doesn't help since it is not possible to add Picard stage z-axis to the config file or modify the serial number.


We've tried to copy the latest Picard .dll-files from the recent Micro-Manager nightly build but the problem persists. Are there some other files we should copy and replace as well? Of course we can still download and configure the non-updated package from openspim.org and be happy using that older version without any problems. Still it would be nice to be up-to-date. Anyone having the same problems or some solutions? Thanks!

As you suspected, this is because of the change in step size.

The error when modifying a configuration or creating new configurations 
is a different problem entirely, and one I wasn't aware of. If you 
could, please, attach a CoreLog or two from after the update, when 
you've received these errors. (If you can't tell which one contains 
these errors, you can open them and search, or just run the program 
again and produce a new one.) This would go a long way towards figuring 
out what's causing this problem.

But in the meantime, an easy, dirty solution to the problem interfering 
with your experiments is to open a working configuration file in 
Notepad. You should see a line in there that reads something like

"Device,Picard Twister,StepSize,1.8"

Changing the 1.8 to 1 should resolve at least the rotational stage problem.

You shouldn't need any other files; hopefully the above is all it takes 
to get things running until I can figure out what's causing the trouble 
with editing configurations.

Hope this helps,

Hi Luke,


Thanks for your reply! I attach here different CoreLogs created by two different software versions:


The first CoreLog pid3156 is generated by the latest SW version. Here we tried to make a new configuration and adding/editing Picard Z-stage is not possible [IFO,dev:Picard Z Stage] Could not initialize motor -1 (PiUsb error code 1).


The next one pid4032 is generated by the same SW version, and we tried to modify an existing older .cfg-file which is also attached here.


The last CoreLog (no pid number) is generated by the non-updated SW version downloaded from openspim.org. Here everything is fine.



There is no possibility to edit the old .cfg-file with notepad like you suggested, since there is no mention about the Twister step size. Maybe because there is no possibility to edit step sizes in the older SW version, only serial numbers?


Regards,

Veli-Pekka

Hi,
I just wanted to say that I also have been experiencing the errors and
removal of all components when I try to edit an existing configuration
file, as Veli-Pekka mentions, but I am however able to add the stage and
all components back, and I can add them to a new configuration file as
well.  So I haven't worried about this problem.  I attach a corelog and
recently created configuration file.
Also, the strange noise that my x,y, and z stages were making has
disappeared, I'm not sure when.  But thanks Luke, in case you fixed that.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1408191730030.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi Ulrik,

I hope you do not mind discussing this in the public; as OpenSPIM is an
open project, I took the liberty of starting this mail thread on an open
mailing list.

As you pointed out, the SPIMAcquisition plugin does not work with the
current nightly builds of Micro-Manager. The reason is that starting
August 1st, Christian Weisiger went real crazy with refactoring.

In preparation of submitting the plugin upstream, I extracted the source,
cleaned up some things and adjusted the source code to the API changes in
Micro-Manager. The source code is here:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

I attached a compiled version and would like to ask you to test with the
current OpenSPIM setup to which you have access.

Could you please get back to me (preferably replying-to-all) with the
results?

Thank you,
Johannes

Hi Jon,

[I hope you do not mind that I re-Cc:ed the mailing list; I really want to
keep OpenSPIM an open project, inviting participation even in discussions
such as this one.]

Thanks for the praise, and awesome work on the diSPIM plugin!

Oh, you are preaching to the choir. I never intended to deviate as far as
we do now, it just happened. And yes, I want to get this plugin back into
Micro-Manager as soon as I can verify that the current revision works. And
by "I", I mean Ulrik ;-)
?
So don't worry: I will submit this code to the Micro-Manager project as
soon as possible (I am in good contact with Mark and Chris, we had a mini
hackathon in Madison where we had to take care of different things than
getting OpenSPIM code merged, unfortunately).

Ciao,
Johannes

Message-ID: <92DD9FD2-2681-4DEE-A5BF-EC2FB39CA31C@mpi-cbg.de>

Dear all,

several participants of the EMBO course on light sheet microscopy here in Dresden (http://openspim.org/EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy) asked about the FEP tube sample mounting. There is a page in the wiki which summarizes all the necessary information:

http://openspim.org/Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation

There, you find details on the tubes we are using, and the links to the JoVE video tutorial and to the Development paper. Hope that helps!

Best,
Michael

 From the core log, I see the line "2014-08-18T09:27:19.082080 tid860 
[IFO,dev:Picard Twister] Found 0 motors and 1 twisters." -- in essence, 
it isn't finding any of your stages. Probably this is because the 
version of mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll is out-of-date, and only checks the 
serial numbers up to 250. (A newer version is available in vanilla 
Micro-Manager that checks up to 500, and I've been looking into a more 
reasonable detector that should discover any regardless of serial 
number...) I will try to upload a newer version of the DAL to the update 
site, once I'm sure it's compatible.

Another odd issue. I think it's related, but I'm not totally sure how -- 
something about the first failure to communicate with the stage seems to 
trigger a series of Java errors referring to the rest of the devices in 
the configuration (I think).

You're probably right. It may work to simply add the line I mentioned, 
only with the '1' instead of '1.8'. (Again, this isn't a fix for the 
underlying problem, but I'll be looking at that.)

I hope this all helps, and I'll see what I can do about causing a more 
permanent change. Thanks!

Hi Aurelia,

Interestingly, the 'suggested' diffs didn't seem to be lining up all 
that often -- and there's certainly enough shape information there for 
the phase correlation to have corrected for the displacement... It may 
be that a change in imglib2 has caused these effects, but it could just 
as easily be that the suggested diffs are being written improperly. 
Perhaps the phase correlation algorithm has changed somehow, and it's 
picking non-ideal correlation shifts? (This could possibly cause the 
entirely-automatic corrections to under-correct.)

A few other ideas to check:

- Is it possible the camera or its firmware is reversing the image 
horizontally (as some webcams do, to produce the 'mirror' effect)? And 
is your camera mounted right-side up? i.e. is the top of the frame in 
the direction of the top of the sample chamber?
- Did the flip or mirror device settings have an effect? (I don't know 
that the PicardStage device adapter respects the 'flip' setting; a quirk 
in the MM programming made this next to impossible last time I tried.)
- How's the contrast/signal when looking at your sample?

This would be a lot less confusing if our earlier anti-drift tests had 
shown the same behavior! ;-)

As a final thought, could you try guiding the anti-drift through an 
entire acquisition? It would help narrow the search by determining if 
the automatic (phase-correlation) correction is to blame for this issue, 
or if the anti-drift in general is at fault.

Hi Luke,

Thanks again! It's nice to hear some logic behind these errors, and I think this solved the problem! Amazing, but earlier we copied that mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll from ?Manager recent "nightly build" and it did not work. Now we copied the file from the latest 1.4.18 -release (July 31st) and everything works fine. We can create new configurations and modify old ones. Also twister rotation angles correspond with the angle adjustments made in the "acquire spim images" -plugin even without modifying the old .cfg -file. I'm not sure what was the role of a very recent update of the acquire spim images -plugin that we installed just before testing. I hope you find some good general solution, but for us all good for now, thank you very much!

Regards,
Veli-Pekka

Hi Luke,



Thanks for your reply! I attach here different CoreLogs created by two different software versions:
Thanks! These have really helped.

The first CoreLog pid3156 is generated by the latest SW version. Here we tried to make a new configuration and adding/editing Picard Z-stage is not possible [IFO,dev:Picard Z Stage] Could not initialize motor -1 (PiUsb error code 1).
>From the core log, I see the line "2014-08-18T09:27:19.082080 tid860 [IFO,dev:Picard Twister] Found 0 motors and 1 twisters." -- in essence, it isn't finding any of your stages. Probably this is because the version of mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll is out-of-date, and only checks the serial numbers up to 250. (A newer version is available in vanilla Micro-Manager that checks up to 500, and I've been looking into a more reasonable detector that should discover any regardless of serial number...) I will try to upload a newer version of the DAL to the update site, once I'm sure it's compatible.

The next one pid4032 is generated by the same SW version, and we tried to modify an existing older .cfg-file which is also attached here.
Another odd issue. I think it's related, but I'm not totally sure how -- something about the first failure to communicate with the stage seems to trigger a series of Java errors referring to the rest of the devices in the configuration (I think).

The last CoreLog (no pid number) is generated by the non-updated SW version downloaded from openspim.org. Here everything is fine.



There is no possibility to edit the old .cfg-file with notepad like you suggested, since there is no mention about the Twister step size. Maybe because there is no possibility to edit step sizes in the older SW version, only serial numbers?
You're probably right. It may work to simply add the line I mentioned, only with the '1' instead of '1.8'. (Again, this isn't a fix for the underlying problem, but I'll be looking at that.)

I hope this all helps, and I'll see what I can do about causing a more permanent change. Thanks!

Luke

Hi Veli-Pekka,

Changing angle from -180 deg to 180 deg rotates the sample holder only ~180 degrees, and rotation in general spins the sample much less than indicated by the slider. In addition, we can not access and modify old .cfg-files, so that it would be possible to change step size of the twister from 1.8 to 1, as it was discussed earlier: http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-July/000482.html .
As you suspected, this is because of the change in step size.
Modification of an existing configuration starts with an error "Error in device Picard Z Stage: Unable to communicate with the device" followed by lots of COM and "No device with label _device name_" -errors. Creating a new configuration doesn't help since it is not possible to add Picard stage z-axis to the config file or modify the serial number.
The error when modifying a configuration or creating new configurations is a different problem entirely, and one I wasn't aware of. If you could, please, attach a CoreLog or two from after the update, when you've received these errors. (If you can't tell which one contains these errors, you can open them and search, or just run the program again and produce a new one.) This would go a long way towards figuring out what's causing this problem.

But in the meantime, an easy, dirty solution to the problem interfering with your experiments is to open a working configuration file in Notepad. You should see a line in there that reads something like

"Device,Picard Twister,StepSize,1.8"

Changing the 1.8 to 1 should resolve at least the rotational stage problem.

We've tried to copy the latest Picard .dll-files from the recent Micro-Manager nightly build but the problem persists. Are there some other files we should copy and replace as well? Of course we can still download and configure the non-updated package from openspim.org and be happy using that older version without any problems. Still it would be nice to be up-to-date. Anyone having the same problems or some solutions? Thanks!
You shouldn't need any other files; hopefully the above is all it takes to get things running until I can figure out what's causing the trouble with editing configurations.

Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1408260823500.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi all,

for roughly 9h already, our wiki will convert newly uploaded .mp4 files
into .ogv files and "upload" them, too.

This is important because the little thumbnail player will only work on
.ogv files (this is actually not a failing of the wiki, but of the
"standard": some web browsers only implement support for .mp4 movies,
others only for .ogv files, and the HTML standard allows for that!)

So what does this mean for you? Simple: if you upload a file, say,
"light-sheet-happens.mp4", you should then use
[[File:light-sheet-happens.ogv]] (note the differentfile extension) in the
wiki page to obtain those nice inlined movie players kniwn from the
Gallery page.

I will work on the wiki a bit more today so that stacks saved via
File>Save As>Zip... and uploaded to the wiki will also be available as
.ogv files, for even more convenience.

Happy spimming,
Johannes

P.S.: I will upload converted .ogv files for .mp4 files missing their
counterpart manually, later today.

PAvel convinced me that a much better idea would be to support .avi files
because you can export them directly from even bare bones ImageJ 1.x.

Take home message: once you have something cool that looks nice as a
movie, just call File>Save As>AVI... in Fiji/ImageJ and upload it to the
wiki. You should then use it as an .ogv file in the wiki page (e.g. if you
upload Reconstructed.avi, you should use [[File:Reconstructed.ogv]].

Hi Britta, and in particular EMBO course participants using the ultramicroscope,

said microscope's software puts brackets into file names (what's next? I

In addition to looking awkward and making for very long file names, this
also triggers a design flaw in ImageJ 1.x' macro language: closing
brackets are misinterpreted to indicate the end of macro parameters, and
consequently, say, a recorded File>Import>Image Sequence... will fail to
open anything.

To work around this issue, Britta suggested to write a macro that lets you
pick the directory containing the problematic files and rename them. This
macro exists now, in File>Fix Funny Filenames (simply update and restart
your Fiji).

If you find that the macro is incomplete, or wrong, or if you just want to
inspect the code for your education, reading pleasure, or to change it to
do something slightly different, feel free to hold down the Shift key
before clicking on the menu item "Fix Funny Filenames"; this will open the
macro in the script editor instead of executing it.

And of course, if you make changes to the macro, please feel free to share
the modified version here; that way we will keep the incredible spirit
felt at the EMBO course alive!

Ciao,
Johannes

Dear EMBO course participants!

We are really excited to welcome you to the EMBO practical course about
light sheet microscopy!

In preparation for the course, we added a couple of pages to the OpenSPIM
wiki; the top-level entry is this page:

	http://openspim.org/EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy

Also, we subscribed you all to the OpenSPIM mailing list; this is the best
way to communicate OpenSPIM related topics, such as the mail you are
reading right now!

We also created accounts and user pages for all of you; please have a
look:

	http://openspim.org/EMBO_2014_Participants

You should have received a mail with an activation link by now; please
activate your account now unless you have already done so.

At this stage, I would like to ask you to find your user page and edit it
(if you have not edited any wiki yet and need help with this, please have
a look at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents and do not hesitate

Hi Aurelia,

Sorry about the delay; I've just moved across the States, and ran into 
enormous trouble getting my internet connection established.

It's interesting to me that Y isn't affected -- I presume you've tried 
this same test with a slight Y correction? And how did you measure your 
pixel size/have you verified its accuracy? Is this same test repeatable? 
I've been working on a test to validate the behavior of the anti-drift, 
and while it's not yet advanced enough for me to be certain there's no 
software fault here, I haven't been able to obtain these dramatic jerks 
so far.

When anti-drift is on, the software produces a directory containing some 
images useful for debugging problems with it -- if it's not too large, 
could you compress and send those files? (If they're more than a few 
megabytes, you can probably send it directly to me to spare other users' 
inboxes.) They might also help identify any problems.

Hope these questions help shed some light on the issue,
Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks!  I'll send you the anti-drift debugging images in a moment.  I
measured pixel size by taking a picture of my calibration grid and counting
pixels per line.  I only vaguely verified its accuracy by checking that the
displacement of the embryo in the composite image I sent before was about
the same as the correction listed in the anti-drift log file, and since
they match approximately, I didn't look further.  I could use the "move a
bead with the stage" method to check this more carefully, but it seems to
be about right.
The test is very repeatable, and in the case of making a small correction
to either Y or Z the stage moves to the suggested location and then doesn't
move significantly afterwards.
Let me know if you think of some more helpful test I could do.  I'm not
certain that there isn't some hardware oddity causing this, but so far I
haven't figured out what it could be.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <dd7029c83d4a472a841d50a2b2cb83a6@nippu12.univ.yo.oulu.fi>

Dear all,


We've been scanning some mouse tissue test samples with our dual-side illumination OpenSPIM for a short while now, and we are very happy with the first results!


We have used the original software package downloaded from openspim.org without any updates, and it has been working fine. However, now after using the Fiji updater Picard USB-stage rotation angle coordinates are not right anymore. Changing angle from -180 deg to 180 deg rotates the sample holder only ~180 degrees, and rotation in general spins the sample much less than indicated by the slider. In addition, we can not access and modify old .cfg-files, so that it would be possible to change step size of the twister from 1.8 to 1, as it was discussed earlier: http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-July/000482.html . Modification of an existing configuration starts with an error "Error in device Picard Z Stage: Unable to communicate with the device" followed by lots of COM and "No device with label _device name_" -errors. Creating a new configuration doesn't help since it is not possible to add Picard stage z-axis to the config file or modify the serial number.


We've tried to copy the latest Picard .dll-files from the recent Micro-Manager nightly build but the problem persists. Are there some other files we should copy and replace as well? Of course we can still download and configure the non-updated package from openspim.org and be happy using that older version without any problems. Still it would be nice to be up-to-date. Anyone having the same problems or some solutions? Thanks!

As you suspected, this is because of the change in step size.

The error when modifying a configuration or creating new configurations 
is a different problem entirely, and one I wasn't aware of. If you 
could, please, attach a CoreLog or two from after the update, when 
you've received these errors. (If you can't tell which one contains 
these errors, you can open them and search, or just run the program 
again and produce a new one.) This would go a long way towards figuring 
out what's causing this problem.

But in the meantime, an easy, dirty solution to the problem interfering 
with your experiments is to open a working configuration file in 
Notepad. You should see a line in there that reads something like

"Device,Picard Twister,StepSize,1.8"

Changing the 1.8 to 1 should resolve at least the rotational stage problem.

You shouldn't need any other files; hopefully the above is all it takes 
to get things running until I can figure out what's causing the trouble 
with editing configurations.

Hi Luke,


Thanks for your reply! I attach here different CoreLogs created by two different software versions:


The first CoreLog pid3156 is generated by the latest SW version. Here we tried to make a new configuration and adding/editing Picard Z-stage is not possible [IFO,dev:Picard Z Stage] Could not initialize motor -1 (PiUsb error code 1).


The next one pid4032 is generated by the same SW version, and we tried to modify an existing older .cfg-file which is also attached here.


The last CoreLog (no pid number) is generated by the non-updated SW version downloaded from openspim.org. Here everything is fine.



There is no possibility to edit the old .cfg-file with notepad like you suggested, since there is no mention about the Twister step size. Maybe because there is no possibility to edit step sizes in the older SW version, only serial numbers?


Regards,

Veli-Pekka

Hi,
I just wanted to say that I also have been experiencing the errors and
removal of all components when I try to edit an existing configuration
file, as Veli-Pekka mentions, but I am however able to add the stage and
all components back, and I can add them to a new configuration file as
well.  So I haven't worried about this problem.  I attach a corelog and
recently created configuration file.
Also, the strange noise that my x,y, and z stages were making has
disappeared, I'm not sure when.  But thanks Luke, in case you fixed that.

Aurelia

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1408191730030.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi Ulrik,

I hope you do not mind discussing this in the public; as OpenSPIM is an
open project, I took the liberty of starting this mail thread on an open
mailing list.

As you pointed out, the SPIMAcquisition plugin does not work with the
current nightly builds of Micro-Manager. The reason is that starting
August 1st, Christian Weisiger went real crazy with refactoring.

In preparation of submitting the plugin upstream, I extracted the source,
cleaned up some things and adjusted the source code to the API changes in
Micro-Manager. The source code is here:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition

I attached a compiled version and would like to ask you to test with the
current OpenSPIM setup to which you have access.

Could you please get back to me (preferably replying-to-all) with the
results?

Thank you,
Johannes

Hi Jon,

[I hope you do not mind that I re-Cc:ed the mailing list; I really want to
keep OpenSPIM an open project, inviting participation even in discussions
such as this one.]

Thanks for the praise, and awesome work on the diSPIM plugin!

Oh, you are preaching to the choir. I never intended to deviate as far as
we do now, it just happened. And yes, I want to get this plugin back into
Micro-Manager as soon as I can verify that the current revision works. And
by "I", I mean Ulrik ;-)
 
So don't worry: I will submit this code to the Micro-Manager project as
soon as possible (I am in good contact with Mark and Chris, we had a mini
hackathon in Madison where we had to take care of different things than
getting OpenSPIM code merged, unfortunately).

Ciao,
Johannes

Message-ID: <92DD9FD2-2681-4DEE-A5BF-EC2FB39CA31C@mpi-cbg.de>

Dear all,

several participants of the EMBO course on light sheet microscopy here in Dresden (http://openspim.org/EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy) asked about the FEP tube sample mounting. There is a page in the wiki which summarizes all the necessary information:

http://openspim.org/Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation

There, you find details on the tubes we are using, and the links to the JoVE video tutorial and to the Development paper. Hope that helps!

Best,
Michael

 From the core log, I see the line "2014-08-18T09:27:19.082080 tid860 
[IFO,dev:Picard Twister] Found 0 motors and 1 twisters." -- in essence, 
it isn't finding any of your stages. Probably this is because the 
version of mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll is out-of-date, and only checks the 
serial numbers up to 250. (A newer version is available in vanilla 
Micro-Manager that checks up to 500, and I've been looking into a more 
reasonable detector that should discover any regardless of serial 
number...) I will try to upload a newer version of the DAL to the update 
site, once I'm sure it's compatible.

Another odd issue. I think it's related, but I'm not totally sure how -- 
something about the first failure to communicate with the stage seems to 
trigger a series of Java errors referring to the rest of the devices in 
the configuration (I think).

You're probably right. It may work to simply add the line I mentioned, 
only with the '1' instead of '1.8'. (Again, this isn't a fix for the 
underlying problem, but I'll be looking at that.)

I hope this all helps, and I'll see what I can do about causing a more 
permanent change. Thanks!

Hi Aurelia,

Interestingly, the 'suggested' diffs didn't seem to be lining up all 
that often -- and there's certainly enough shape information there for 
the phase correlation to have corrected for the displacement... It may 
be that a change in imglib2 has caused these effects, but it could just 
as easily be that the suggested diffs are being written improperly. 
Perhaps the phase correlation algorithm has changed somehow, and it's 
picking non-ideal correlation shifts? (This could possibly cause the 
entirely-automatic corrections to under-correct.)

A few other ideas to check:

- Is it possible the camera or its firmware is reversing the image 
horizontally (as some webcams do, to produce the 'mirror' effect)? And 
is your camera mounted right-side up? i.e. is the top of the frame in 
the direction of the top of the sample chamber?
- Did the flip or mirror device settings have an effect? (I don't know 
that the PicardStage device adapter respects the 'flip' setting; a quirk 
in the MM programming made this next to impossible last time I tried.)
- How's the contrast/signal when looking at your sample?

This would be a lot less confusing if our earlier anti-drift tests had 
shown the same behavior! ;-)

As a final thought, could you try guiding the anti-drift through an 
entire acquisition? It would help narrow the search by determining if 
the automatic (phase-correlation) correction is to blame for this issue, 
or if the anti-drift in general is at fault.

Hi Luke,

Thanks again! It's nice to hear some logic behind these errors, and I think this solved the problem! Amazing, but earlier we copied that mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll from µManager recent "nightly build" and it did not work. Now we copied the file from the latest 1.4.18 -release (July 31st) and everything works fine. We can create new configurations and modify old ones. Also twister rotation angles correspond with the angle adjustments made in the "acquire spim images" -plugin even without modifying the old .cfg -file. I'm not sure what was the role of a very recent update of the acquire spim images -plugin that we installed just before testing. I hope you find some good general solution, but for us all good for now, thank you very much!

Regards,
Veli-Pekka

Hi Luke,



Thanks for your reply! I attach here different CoreLogs created by two different software versions:
Thanks! These have really helped.

The first CoreLog pid3156 is generated by the latest SW version. Here we tried to make a new configuration and adding/editing Picard Z-stage is not possible [IFO,dev:Picard Z Stage] Could not initialize motor -1 (PiUsb error code 1).
>From the core log, I see the line "2014-08-18T09:27:19.082080 tid860 [IFO,dev:Picard Twister] Found 0 motors and 1 twisters." -- in essence, it isn't finding any of your stages. Probably this is because the version of mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll is out-of-date, and only checks the serial numbers up to 250. (A newer version is available in vanilla Micro-Manager that checks up to 500, and I've been looking into a more reasonable detector that should discover any regardless of serial number...) I will try to upload a newer version of the DAL to the update site, once I'm sure it's compatible.

The next one pid4032 is generated by the same SW version, and we tried to modify an existing older .cfg-file which is also attached here.
Another odd issue. I think it's related, but I'm not totally sure how -- something about the first failure to communicate with the stage seems to trigger a series of Java errors referring to the rest of the devices in the configuration (I think).

The last CoreLog (no pid number) is generated by the non-updated SW version downloaded from openspim.org. Here everything is fine.



There is no possibility to edit the old .cfg-file with notepad like you suggested, since there is no mention about the Twister step size. Maybe because there is no possibility to edit step sizes in the older SW version, only serial numbers?
You're probably right. It may work to simply add the line I mentioned, only with the '1' instead of '1.8'. (Again, this isn't a fix for the underlying problem, but I'll be looking at that.)

I hope this all helps, and I'll see what I can do about causing a more permanent change. Thanks!

Luke

Hi Veli-Pekka,

However, now after using the Fiji updater Picard USB-stage rotation angle coordinates are not right anymore. Changing angle from -180 deg to 180 deg rotates the sample holder only ~180 degrees, and rotation in general spins the sample much less than indicated by the slider. In addition, we can not access and modify old .cfg-files, so that it would be possible to change step size of the twister from 1.8 to 1, as it was discussed earlier: http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2014-July/000482.html .
As you suspected, this is because of the change in step size.
Modification of an existing configuration starts with an error "Error in device Picard Z Stage: Unable to communicate with the device" followed by lots of COM and "No device with label _device name_" -errors. Creating a new configuration doesn't help since it is not possible to add Picard stage z-axis to the config file or modify the serial number.
The error when modifying a configuration or creating new configurations is a different problem entirely, and one I wasn't aware of. If you could, please, attach a CoreLog or two from after the update, when you've received these errors. (If you can't tell which one contains these errors, you can open them and search, or just run the program again and produce a new one.) This would go a long way towards figuring out what's causing this problem.

But in the meantime, an easy, dirty solution to the problem interfering with your experiments is to open a working configuration file in Notepad. You should see a line in there that reads something like

"Device,Picard Twister,StepSize,1.8"

Changing the 1.8 to 1 should resolve at least the rotational stage problem.

We've tried to copy the latest Picard .dll-files from the recent Micro-Manager nightly build but the problem persists. Are there some other files we should copy and replace as well? Of course we can still download and configure the non-updated package from openspim.org and be happy using that older version without any problems. Still it would be nice to be up-to-date. Anyone having the same problems or some solutions? Thanks!
You shouldn't need any other files; hopefully the above is all it takes to get things running until I can figure out what's causing the trouble with editing configurations.

Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1408260823500.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi all,

for roughly 9h already, our wiki will convert newly uploaded .mp4 files
into .ogv files and "upload" them, too.

This is important because the little thumbnail player will only work on
.ogv files (this is actually not a failing of the wiki, but of the
"standard": some web browsers only implement support for .mp4 movies,
others only for .ogv files, and the HTML standard allows for that!)

So what does this mean for you? Simple: if you upload a file, say,
"light-sheet-happens.mp4", you should then use
[[File:light-sheet-happens.ogv]] (note the differentfile extension) in the
wiki page to obtain those nice inlined movie players kniwn from the
Gallery page.

I will work on the wiki a bit more today so that stacks saved via
File>Save As>Zip... and uploaded to the wiki will also be available as
.ogv files, for even more convenience.

Happy spimming,
Johannes

P.S.: I will upload converted .ogv files for .mp4 files missing their
counterpart manually, later today.

PAvel convinced me that a much better idea would be to support .avi files
because you can export them directly from even bare bones ImageJ 1.x.

Take home message: once you have something cool that looks nice as a
movie, just call File>Save As>AVI... in Fiji/ImageJ and upload it to the
wiki. You should then use it as an .ogv file in the wiki page (e.g. if you
upload Reconstructed.avi, you should use [[File:Reconstructed.ogv]].

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Macro to fix Ultramicroscope file names
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1408291055300.990@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi Britta, and in particular EMBO course participants using the ultramicroscope,

said microscope's software puts brackets into file names (what's next? I
fully expect somebody to put in musical notes, animals and little babies
into file names within the next years).

In addition to looking awkward and making for very long file names, this
also triggers a design flaw in ImageJ 1.x' macro language: closing
brackets are misinterpreted to indicate the end of macro parameters, and
consequently, say, a recorded File>Import>Image Sequence... will fail to
open anything.

To work around this issue, Britta suggested to write a macro that lets you
pick the directory containing the problematic files and rename them. This
macro exists now, in File>Fix Funny Filenames (simply update and restart
your Fiji).

If you find that the macro is incomplete, or wrong, or if you just want to
inspect the code for your education, reading pleasure, or to change it to
do something slightly different, feel free to hold down the Shift key
before clicking on the menu item "Fix Funny Filenames"; this will open the
macro in the script editor instead of executing it.

And of course, if you make changes to the macro, please feel free to share
the modified version here; that way we will keep the incredible spirit
felt at the EMBO course alive!

Ciao,
Johannes
