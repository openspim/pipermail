Hi OpenSPIMists,

I have a plain vanilla OpenSpim that I set up > a year ago. Recently I 
noticed that the acquisition speed dropped to 1.5 frames/s. This is also 
the case when I am not moving the stage (single slice time lapse) and 
keeping the laser on continuously. I remember that was not a problem 
initially and that I got something like 10 frames/s in a z-stack which 
was good enough for me.
I can record with the full frame rate of the camera in micromanager so 
this doesn't seem to be the problem either.

I also tried the new 64bit version (which works fine btw.) but that did 
not change anything in terms of acquisition speed.

Any help is really appreciated!

Robert

Just for clarity (and so that it can be written explicitely in the wiki,  
github and so on :) ):

if I want to get OpenSPIM through fiji update site, I also need to  
activate the MicroManager-dev update site, or will it be installed  
automatically as a dependency of OpenSPIM?

It will be added automatically when you restart after activating the 
OpenSPIM update site.

Hello Johannes,

I updated the fiji with OpenSPIM, and after the restart it works just like you say. However, afterwards when homes the the 4D-stage (with the USB-Slide-II motors), the motors lose connection and I need to pull the connection out of the USB hub and restart.

By the way, I just noticed that you edited the Wiki to reflect the 
current state of the OpenSPIM software. Thank you for being so active in 
the OpenSPIM project!

Please start the OpenSPIM software from the command-line as described 
[here](http://fiji.sc/Command_Line_Debugging), reproduce the issue by 
homing the stage and paste the console output into a reply.

And what version of Micro-Manager will be downloaded? The last release, 
the nightly build, or something else?  I'm confused, because in the 
"About MicroManager" it says "MM Studio version: 1.4.22 20150430, MMCore 
version 7.0.2" (I updated today) while on the Micro-Manager website it 
says "Download Micro-Manager Latest Release, Micro-Manager 1.4.21 (April 
30, 2015) ". Yet the newest nightly build is from May 4th.

I'm asking because I'm having issues with Micromanager, more precisely 
with Tools->Pixel Size Calibration, and I'm wondering whether going to 
an older or newer version would remove them.

Regards,
Monika

The Micro-Manager-dev update site is populated automatically by the 
nightly build (read: by Micro-Manager's very own Jenkins job).

Yeah, 1.4.22 is definitely wrong, most likely a typo (or preparing for 
the next release which is due July 31st).

The version you have as per the Micro-Manager-dev update site would be 
most appropriately described as 1.4.22-SNAPSHOT, i.e. a volatile version 
leading up to 1.4.22.

The Micro-Manager developers are extremely helpful and nice, and they 
are very responsive (but keep in mind that they are in a different time 
zone: San Francisco, i.e. 9 hours behind us). I would suggest to write a 
mail to micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net that describes the 
problem precisely -- ideally in such a manner that it is easy for any 
reader to reproduce the problem quickly. In my experience, most such bug 
descriptions on the mailing list are addressed swiftly.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello fellow OpenSPIMoids, especially of the software developing 
variety,

I just stumbled over this mail that implies that we need to adjust the 
code of the SPIMAcquisition plugin. Takers?

Z stages can now implement Home(), as of SVN r15408.

There was a bug report yesterday: 
https://github.com/bigdataviewer/SPIM_Registration/issues/41

While it concerned CZI files, I imagine that OME Tiff files might expose 
similar problems. If you stumble over such problems, I would suggest 
doing exactly the same as Mario: report the problem on GitHub. Steffi is 
always busy, of course, as we all are, yet he is always helpful.

Ciao,

Howdy Johannes,

Here's what I got from the Debug console, along with another core log. I
hope it helps... BTW, the console kept on making more and more errors
after I homed the stage, but I assume that they are the same message.

The motors completely disconnect (go red) from the device manager after
the procedure, so I have to unplug the hub and reconnect to get them
back.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi All and especially Pete,

My setup is Orca R2, Coherent Cube, Picard stage.
I tested a couple of things and it it still unclear to me where the time 
is wasted.

I attached the core log of a 10 frame long time series (100ms exposure) 
recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta all unchecked and  without 
"Update Live preview".

I tried two configurations:
1. Orca  + Cube + Picard
2. Orca  + Picard

"1" took 7.6 s of which ("1"- "2") = 1.4 s are communication with laser, 
which, while way too much, is not the source of the problem.

Profiler("performAcquisition")[4 children]: 7.6113s
0.0017%:    Profiler("Output")[0 children]: 0.0001s
0.0000%:    Profiler("Acquisition")[0 children]: 0.0000s
24.0133%:    Profiler("Movement")[0 children]: 1.8277s
0.0013%:    Profiler("Setup")[0 children]: 0.0001s

So most of the time the system is doing something that the Profiler is 
not recording.

Looking at the core log I am a bit puzzled why the laser power is 
queried once  per slice and why the stage is told to move to the very 
position it currently is even though none of the motors should move at 
all since X/Y/Z/Theta are all unchecked in the acquisition dialog.

I would really appreciate any hint/suggestion on how to get back to 
reasonable acquisition speeds.

Thanks again!

Robert

Subject: [OpenSPIM] very slow acquisition speed
In-Reply-To: <mailman.4342.1431012438.3596.openspim@openspim.org>

Dear Robert,

since I also have Orca+Picard, I decided to repeat your experiment and 
did 10 frames, 100 ms. I'm using the new 64-bit version, updated. I got 
very similar results to yours (see below). Unfortunately I don't know 
whether it used to be better, I never tried taking very fast 
measurements.

Maybe somebody who is able to get 10 frames/sec could send their CoreLog 
for comparison...?

Opened log file 
D:\Dane\2015\2015_05\2015_05_07\02time_series_test\log.txt
Profiler("performAcquisition")[4 children]: 6,0611s

29,7792%:    Profiler("Movement")[0 children]: 1,8049s

Regards,
Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] New Micro-Manager API: Home()
In-Reply-To: <mailman.4303.1430923337.3596.openspim@openspim.org>
References: <mailman.4303.1430923337.3596.openspim@openspim.org>
Message-ID: <d551ed95dc93c8e98d53d560336b288e@nencki.gov.pl>

I tried to do it, just to see whether I can, but I can't and I feel that 
again the problem is not having sufficient information :/ How can I find 
out how this "SVN r15408" relates to the version available via 
Micro-Manager-Dev update site? Because in this version (the mysterious 
MM Studio version: 1.4.22 20150430) calling core.home(label) for the Z 
stage, just like it's done for the X/Y stage, throws exception.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Monika,

Unfortunately, it is not recorded. However, you can see the original 
Subversion revision (which the "SVN r15408" is referring to) in the 
commit message of our Git mirror, on the bottom of the commit messages. 
For example, r15408 corresponds to 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/c46cd66d43e7fd55045ee690e281833dc0583d99 
which was committed on Tuesday, May 5th, so it should be in the nightly 
build as of Wednesday, May 6th (and as a consequence on the 
Micro-Manager-dev update site the same day, or at least one day later).

It appears that this error message comes from 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/f88b6b5ff341061d777511e33c7291a3d498d431/MMCore/DeviceManager.h#L97 
(I called `git grep "of the wrong type"` to find out).

The commit you referenced replaced the `GetDeviceOfType()` call in 
`MMCore::home()` with a `GetDevice()` call: 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/c46cd66d43e7fd55045ee690e281833dc0583d99#diff-66e4d1b12dce965612b0d94db6c9f1d6R1619 
-- therefore I think that this line:

> mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.CMMCore_home(Native Method)

hints at outdated Micro-Manager binaries. Having said that, it appears 
as if the Micro-Manager-dev update site has not been updated in a couple 
of days: http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/mm/win64/?C=M;O=D

I have to run right now, but will investigate more later.

Thank you,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] orca er problem
Message-ID: <D173F051.42E64%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I tried switching to Windows 7 64 bit from a windows 7 32 bit system.
Everything worked but my Orca ER began taking split images...the left
third of the image is spliced on to the right 2/3 if that makes sense. I
switched back to the 32 bit system, but the Orca problem persisted. I
switched out the Orca er, cables and control box for another we had on
hand and the problem persists. I re-installed micromanager/openspim and
the Hammamatsu DCAM driver and the problem persists. I installed a Windows
hotfix 
(http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Windows%20Server2008%20R2%20SP1/
sp2/Fix363689/7600/free/430510_intl_i386_zip.exe)

The problem persists. Can anyone advise me?

Dear Monika, All,

thanks for testing! At least my system is not the only one that is so slow.

Would be great if someone could tell me how to figure out what is going 
on during the 75% of time that is unaccounted for in the profiler!

thanks!

Best regards,

Robert

The profiler (which one are you using? That information is missing from 
the original report) can only profile Java code, not native code. So my 
guess is that something wonky is going on in the C++ part. 
Alternatively, it could be that the code is just waiting for the motors 
to arrive at the desired position, which would also not be recorded by 
the profiler.

Personally, I would try to go for the Flight Recorder of Java Mission 
Control: http://fiji.sc/Profiling_Java_Code#Java_Mission_Control. There 
is an Eclipse plugin with which you can toggle the flight recording more 
precisely; It is not described in the Fiji wiki because neither I nor 
anybody else found the time to describe it there, but there are links on 
Oracle's site: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/index.html

Ciao,
Johannes

"What is going on" should be relatively easy if you look at the timestamps  
in the log that you send. "Why" and "How to fix it" is a different matter  
unfortunately.

Did you try to take a time series only with Micromanager, without the  
OpenSPIM plugin? This should be possible somehow.

Regards,
Monika

Dear Thomas,

a private mail exchange with me, it is really inconvenient for me: I 
have nothing to gain from a private mail exchange solving this issue -- 
it is taking my time, to solve a problem that is not mine, in a plugin 
that is not mine, and the warm and fuzzy feeling of solving a single 
problem for a single person when nobody else knows what I managed to 
accomplish does not further my career nor does it pay my bills -- while 
a public discussion not only offers the possibility that other people 
than you might benefit from my advice (which would in turn help me), but 
also offers the possibility that other people might help you, relieving 
me.

I really wish that more people were trying to help the OpenSPIM 
community thrive as a publicly visible community. There are some 
laudable examples on the OpenSPIM mailing list recently, and I am very 
thankful for that.

Please note that it is not obvious from your screenshots what amount of 
memory Fiji *actually* reserves. Two Fiji instances running side by 
side, for example, will not have the same amount of memory available 
because Java works by reserving the memory at start-up, and that memory 
is then not available to a second Fiji instance. The ImageJ launcher 
will detect that less memory is available than it was asked to ask for 
and fall back to try with a lesser amount. That is my guess regarding 
what happens on your computer.

By clicking on the status bar, you will see how much memory Fiji's Java 
VM thinks is available. Clicking on the status bar will also trigger a 
so-called "garbage collection", i.e. it will ask the Java VM to 
re-organize its memory consumption. Therefore, sporadically clicking on 
the status bar while the plugin is running might even work around the 
memory issue.

You really scared me when you said that it crashed. You see, "to crash" 
means one very specific thing, and that thing only, when you talk about 
computer programs: it means that the entire application just stopped to 
run, all its windows vanished, without any error message nor a chance to 
store so-far unsaved data.

That is distinctly not what happened. What you saw is an 
OutOfMemoryException which stopped the plugin but nothing else.

It might make sense to open large images in that Fiji instance first, 
until it runs out of memory, in order to determine whether the problem 
lies with the Java VM in general, or with the plugin you are trying to 
run. I am getting the impression that something is wrong with your Fiji 
installation rather than with the SPIM Registration plugin.

Hi,

I put together a time line that visualizes the log file I sent with the 
first email (single slice no stage movement).
 From this I learn that it somehow takes 300 ms to acquire 1 image with 
an exposure time of 100 ms. After that it takes an additional 250 ms 
until the laser is told to turn off. That is ~400 ms unaccounted for.
As I mentioned  I still don't understand why the stage is even engaged 
and the laser power  is queried during acquisition.

As mentioned I can record a time series at full camera frame rate with 
Micromanager alone. No problem whatsoever.

I am using "Profile acquisition" in the SPIM plugin.
I will try to get the results from the Flight Recorder of Java Mission 
Control.

But we are talking about acquiring a time series, will all the motors 
unchecked in the plugin, so all the movements are 0 steps by definition. 
So it's just the communication with the motors that takes 150 ms, not 
any physical movement:

---

I suppose there are two questions, both to somebody with a better 
understanding of Micromanager than I:
1. Why is the communication so slow? (Same goes for Robert's laser)
2. Why does the communication with the motors take place if the distance 
to move is 0? Is this a bug, or is the plugin designed like that? How 
hard would it be to change?

(I'm looking at the code trying to figure out the answer to 2, but I 
don't see it yet)

Monika

Hi,

just for your information - just now the strategy of using  
Fiji+Micro-manager-dev+Openspim is not perfect. The Micro-manager-dev  
update site is not updating since 30.04., and this version has some  
conflicts with the newest version of Fiji, so there might be errors. Below  
the response I got from Micromanager that hopefully explains this better.

(I found about this because I tried to use the Micro-Manager  
Multi-Dimensional Acquisition and I was getting an exception when trying  
to save a stack).

Regards,
Monika

The conflict is in other JARs. We still use an outdated version of
scifio.jar, which conflicts with the newer version in Fiji. We fully
intend to fix this, and it will hopefully not be too hard, but it is not
trivial (we need to make sure we don't introduce issues into file saving
in our official release, and that will require careful testing).

Please consider the Micro-Manager-dev update site to be experimental.

I don't think there is an easy fix at this moment that can be done by
just replacing JARs. We'll keep working on it!

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <D17FCA7F.43253%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I have discovered a problem with micromanager 1.4.22 and the Orca ER. When I take a z-stack the resulting images are split. The left 1/3 of the image is fused to the right 2/3. The problem has something to to do with the Picard stage as taking 10 images quickly without stage movement results in intact images. Taking images of multiple xy positions results in split images. I replaced the Orca ER and associated control box with another Orca ER setup and the problem persisted.  I reinstalled an earlier version of micromanager (1.4.19) and the problem went away. Are earlier versions of Openspim software archived somewhere? I would like to download a version with mm 1.4.19.

Cheers

Hello Aryeh,

At the time we were using a Hamamatsu Orca ER, which is firewire based, hence the need for a computer with a firewire port. A portable laptop computer is a nice thing to have, but not necessary. 

Nowadays we cover many more models of camera, and I would personally suggest that you buy a sCMOS due to their larger field of view and improved speed.  

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Pete,

> sCMOS due to their larger field of view and improved speed.
Since I am having this issue with speed: Would you mind profiling 
("profile acquisition") and sending me the result of a 10 frame long 
time series (100ms exposure) recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta 
all unchecked and  without "Update Live preview".

That would be great!

Robert

Very good -- in this case we have many options, especially with USB3.0.

Howdy Robert,

Can you tell me exactly how you do your tests?! I can repeat them with an Orca ER and an Andor Neo sCMOS, but I want to make sure that it'll be done right.

Regards,
Pete

Hi Pete,

Since I am having this issue with speed: Would you mind profiling 
("profile acquisition") and sending me the result of a 10 frame long 
time series (100ms exposure) recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta 
all unchecked and  without "Update Live preview".

That would be great!

Message-ID: <54811CA7-62AB-4F93-A48B-C7BD45C4846B@pitt.edu>

Hello, 

A couple questions from newbie.  Has anyone who works with zebrafish tried gentle perfusion in the little chambers, say using fine needles and a syringe pump?  Adding drugs or refreshing medium during imaging could be quite useful.  

Separately, If anyone is using openSPIM with two lasers or more I would be grateful to talk off-list about how you implemented it.  

Thanks and all the best,

I would like to encourage a more open discussion. This is the OpenSPIM 
project, after all, and it seems pretty obvious to me that the project 
would benefit more from a discussion *on* this list than from a 
discussion in private.

Ciao,

This bug has been fixed now: it was a bug in the command-line version of 
the updater (that is used in Micro-Manager's automatic population of the 
update site from its nightly builds), and that bug was exposed by a 
faulty upload of the xml-apis.jar to the ImageJ update site itself.

I have fixed both, and uploaded the fixed updater on Friday; As of 
yesterday (Saturday), things are groovy again.

Hi Aryeh,

We have just recently finished the build of a dual side illumination system using the lighthub-6 with 3 laser lines. I will upload pictures and details within next coming weeks on the wiki page. The first point is to go for the lighthub-6 since the price difference is very small. This will allow an expansion in the future with more lasers. The fiber is coupled to a fiber collimator fixed to a holder on a rail to allow for alignment with the beam splitter. Today I would have built it with a small xz stage for improved alignment or at least a sturdier holder of the collimator. There are some examples at Thorlabs. I have added the links to the details that we used in the current setup. It is important to get a good fixation of the collimator especially if you like to use the laser module in other microscopes and regularly shifts the fiber. 

I hope this will help you!

SPIMers,

We have completed a multichannel AOTF modulated 4 line L-SPIM.  We took an AOTF and three retired lasers(442,488,514,568,647) from our spinning disk and designed a DAC based on the Arduino DAC supported by micromanager (the 442 is not quite integrated optically).  We've also incorporated an emission filter wheel and excitation wheel for beam characterizing (the former is integrated in our branch of the SPIMAcquisition plugin).  I plan to have the optics/hardware/software design and example datasets up on the OpenSPIM site in the coming weeks-grant taking precedent.  I'm working with Johannes to get our branch of SPIMAcquisition merged with the release version-waiting on me really.

On the perfusion and environmental control side, we have a summer student that is working on these aspects for our system.  The perfusion is going to be fairly rudimentary.  We will be relying on peristaltic pumps because the volume of our sample chamber is so large (7 ml).  The perfusion system will be setup to work as a recirculating loop as well to deliver dissolved gases CO2 etc as required-via a simple bubbler.  If I can find a CO2 sensor I like(cost to performance) this might be integrated into the bubbler unit.

I'm not crazy about directly heating the chamber with amped up resistors, so we're starting with a "closed-loop" heated reservoir, re-circulator and heat-exchanger-if it works well we may also strap a Peltier based heat pump to the reservoir as well to give us cooling.

In toto there will be a handful of peristaltic pumps, controllers (Arduino as PIDs), media bubblers and heated reservoirs.  As time permits we'll be writing a plugin for micromanager to wrangle all this functionality and add graphs etc-everything you might want out of a comparable Peco or Okolabs solution.

As we make progress I'll update our  to-be-completed OpenSPIM page.
Happy SPIMing!

Seth

Dear Aryeh,

rolling shutter gives you twice the speed, but potential artifacts caused by the time offset across the frame. There are cameras which give you both shutter modes (Andor Zyla etc.), if you are willing to give up some QE. It really depends on your specimen, and what kind of analysis you want to do. Unless you want to quantify rapid movements across the frame (e.g. fast fluidics), I would say rolling shutter is fine.

Best,
Michael

Hi OpenSPIMists,

I have a plain vanilla OpenSpim that I set up > a year ago. Recently I 
noticed that the acquisition speed dropped to 1.5 frames/s. This is also 
the case when I am not moving the stage (single slice time lapse) and 
keeping the laser on continuously. I remember that was not a problem 
initially and that I got something like 10 frames/s in a z-stack which 
was good enough for me.
I can record with the full frame rate of the camera in micromanager so 
this doesn't seem to be the problem either.

I also tried the new 64bit version (which works fine btw.) but that did 
not change anything in terms of acquisition speed.

Any help is really appreciated!

Robert

Just for clarity (and so that it can be written explicitely in the wiki,  
github and so on :) ):

if I want to get OpenSPIM through fiji update site, I also need to  
activate the MicroManager-dev update site, or will it be installed  
automatically as a dependency of OpenSPIM?

It will be added automatically when you restart after activating the 
OpenSPIM update site.

Hello Johannes,

I updated the fiji with OpenSPIM, and after the restart it works just like you say. However, afterwards when homes the the 4D-stage (with the USB-Slide-II motors), the motors lose connection and I need to pull the connection out of the USB hub and restart.

Pete

By the way, I just noticed that you edited the Wiki to reflect the 
current state of the OpenSPIM software. Thank you for being so active in 
the OpenSPIM project!

Please start the OpenSPIM software from the command-line as described 
[here](http://fiji.sc/Command_Line_Debugging), reproduce the issue by 
homing the stage and paste the console output into a reply.

And what version of Micro-Manager will be downloaded? The last release, 
the nightly build, or something else?  I'm confused, because in the 
"About MicroManager" it says "MM Studio version: 1.4.22 20150430, MMCore 
version 7.0.2" (I updated today) while on the Micro-Manager website it 
says "Download Micro-Manager Latest Release, Micro-Manager 1.4.21 (April 
30, 2015) ". Yet the newest nightly build is from May 4th.

I'm asking because I'm having issues with Micromanager, more precisely 
with Tools->Pixel Size Calibration, and I'm wondering whether going to 
an older or newer version would remove them.

Regards,
Monika

The Micro-Manager-dev update site is populated automatically by the 
nightly build (read: by Micro-Manager's very own Jenkins job).

Yeah, 1.4.22 is definitely wrong, most likely a typo (or preparing for 
the next release which is due July 31st).

The version you have as per the Micro-Manager-dev update site would be 
most appropriately described as 1.4.22-SNAPSHOT, i.e. a volatile version 
leading up to 1.4.22.

The Micro-Manager developers are extremely helpful and nice, and they 
are very responsive (but keep in mind that they are in a different time 
zone: San Francisco, i.e. 9 hours behind us). I would suggest to write a 
mail to micro-manager-general at lists.sourceforge.net that describes the 
problem precisely -- ideally in such a manner that it is easy for any 
reader to reproduce the problem quickly. In my experience, most such bug 
descriptions on the mailing list are addressed swiftly.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello fellow OpenSPIMoids, especially of the software developing 
variety,

I just stumbled over this mail that implies that we need to adjust the 
code of the SPIMAcquisition plugin. Takers?

Z stages can now implement Home(), as of SVN r15408.

[I hope you do not mind that I Cc:ed the mailing list; I believe that 
other OpenSPIM people will be interested/helpful]

There was a bug report yesterday: 
https://github.com/bigdataviewer/SPIM_Registration/issues/41

While it concerned CZI files, I imagine that OME Tiff files might expose 
similar problems. If you stumble over such problems, I would suggest 
doing exactly the same as Mario: report the problem on GitHub. Steffi is 
always busy, of course, as we all are, yet he is always helpful.

Ciao,
Dscho

Howdy Johannes,

Here's what I got from the Debug console, along with another core log. I
hope it helps... BTW, the console kept on making more and more errors
after I homed the stage, but I assume that they are the same message.

The motors completely disconnect (go red) from the device manager after
the procedure, so I have to unplug the hub and reconnect to get them
back.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi All and especially Pete,

My setup is Orca R2, Coherent Cube, Picard stage.
I tested a couple of things and it it still unclear to me where the time 
is wasted.

I attached the core log of a 10 frame long time series (100ms exposure) 
recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta all unchecked and  without 
"Update Live preview".

I tried two configurations:
1. Orca  + Cube + Picard
2. Orca  + Picard

"1" took 7.6 s of which ("1"- "2") = 1.4 s are communication with laser, 
which, while way too much, is not the source of the problem.

Profiler("performAcquisition")[4 children]: 7.6113s
0.0017%:    Profiler("Output")[0 children]: 0.0001s
0.0000%:    Profiler("Acquisition")[0 children]: 0.0000s
24.0133%:    Profiler("Movement")[0 children]: 1.8277s
0.0013%:    Profiler("Setup")[0 children]: 0.0001s

So most of the time the system is doing something that the Profiler is 
not recording.

Looking at the core log I am a bit puzzled why the laser power is 
queried once  per slice and why the stage is told to move to the very 
position it currently is even though none of the motors should move at 
all since X/Y/Z/Theta are all unchecked in the acquisition dialog.

I would really appreciate any hint/suggestion on how to get back to 
reasonable acquisition speeds.

Thanks again!

Robert

Subject: [OpenSPIM] very slow acquisition speed
In-Reply-To: <mailman.4342.1431012438.3596.openspim@openspim.org>
References: <mailman.4342.1431012438.3596.openspim@openspim.org>

Dear Robert,

since I also have Orca+Picard, I decided to repeat your experiment and 
did 10 frames, 100 ms. I'm using the new 64-bit version, updated. I got 
very similar results to yours (see below). Unfortunately I don't know 
whether it used to be better, I never tried taking very fast 
measurements.

Maybe somebody who is able to get 10 frames/sec could send their CoreLog 
for comparison...?

Opened log file 
D:\Dane\2015\2015_05\2015_05_07\02time_series_test\log.txt
Profiler("performAcquisition")[4 children]: 6,0611s
6,3337%:    Profiler("Output")[0 children]: 0,3839s
0,0000%:    Profiler("Acquisition")[0 children]: 0,0000s
29,7792%:    Profiler("Movement")[0 children]: 1,8049s
0,0005%:    Profiler("Setup")[0 children]: 0,0000s

Regards,
Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] New Micro-Manager API: Home()
In-Reply-To: <mailman.4303.1430923337.3596.openspim@openspim.org>
References: <mailman.4303.1430923337.3596.openspim@openspim.org>
Message-ID: <d551ed95dc93c8e98d53d560336b288e@nencki.gov.pl>

I tried to do it, just to see whether I can, but I can't and I feel that 
again the problem is not having sufficient information :/ How can I find 
out how this "SVN r15408" relates to the version available via 
Micro-Manager-Dev update site? Because in this version (the mysterious 
MM Studio version: 1.4.22 20150430) calling core.home(label) for the Z 
stage, just like it's done for the X/Y stage, throws exception.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Monika,

Unfortunately, it is not recorded. However, you can see the original 
Subversion revision (which the "SVN r15408" is referring to) in the 
commit message of our Git mirror, on the bottom of the commit messages. 
For example, r15408 corresponds to 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/c46cd66d43e7fd55045ee690e281833dc0583d99 
which was committed on Tuesday, May 5th, so it should be in the nightly 
build as of Wednesday, May 6th (and as a consequence on the 
Micro-Manager-dev update site the same day, or at least one day later).

It appears that this error message comes from 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/f88b6b5ff341061d777511e33c7291a3d498d431/MMCore/DeviceManager.h#L97 
(I called `git grep "of the wrong type"` to find out).

The commit you referenced replaced the `GetDeviceOfType()` call in 
`MMCore::home()` with a `GetDevice()` call: 
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/c46cd66d43e7fd55045ee690e281833dc0583d99#diff-66e4d1b12dce965612b0d94db6c9f1d6R1619 
-- therefore I think that this line:

> mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.CMMCore_home(Native Method)

hints at outdated Micro-Manager binaries. Having said that, it appears 
as if the Micro-Manager-dev update site has not been updated in a couple 
of days: http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/mm/win64/?C=M;O=D

I have to run right now, but will investigate more later.

Thank you,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] orca er problem
Message-ID: <D173F051.42E64%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I tried switching to Windows 7 64 bit from a windows 7 32 bit system.
Everything worked but my Orca ER began taking split images...the left
third of the image is spliced on to the right 2/3 if that makes sense. I
switched back to the 32 bit system, but the Orca problem persisted. I
switched out the Orca er, cables and control box for another we had on
hand and the problem persists. I re-installed micromanager/openspim and
the Hammamatsu DCAM driver and the problem persists. I installed a Windows
hotfix 
(http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Windows%20Server2008%20R2%20SP1/
sp2/Fix363689/7600/free/430510_intl_i386_zip.exe)

The problem persists. Can anyone advise me?

Dear Monika, All,

thanks for testing! At least my system is not the only one that is so slow.

Would be great if someone could tell me how to figure out what is going 
on during the 75% of time that is unaccounted for in the profiler!

thanks!

Best regards,

Robert

The profiler (which one are you using? That information is missing from 
the original report) can only profile Java code, not native code. So my 
guess is that something wonky is going on in the C++ part. 
Alternatively, it could be that the code is just waiting for the motors 
to arrive at the desired position, which would also not be recorded by 
the profiler.

Personally, I would try to go for the Flight Recorder of Java Mission 
Control: http://fiji.sc/Profiling_Java_Code#Java_Mission_Control. There 
is an Eclipse plugin with which you can toggle the flight recording more 
precisely; It is not described in the Fiji wiki because neither I nor 
anybody else found the time to describe it there, but there are links on 
Oracle's site: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/index.html

Ciao,
Johannes

"What is going on" should be relatively easy if you look at the timestamps  
in the log that you send. "Why" and "How to fix it" is a different matter  
unfortunately.

Did you try to take a time series only with Micromanager, without the  
OpenSPIM plugin? This should be possible somehow.

Regards,
Monika

Dear Thomas,

please note that while it is convenient for you to take this problem to 
a private mail exchange with me, it is really inconvenient for me: I 
have nothing to gain from a private mail exchange solving this issue -- 
it is taking my time, to solve a problem that is not mine, in a plugin 
that is not mine, and the warm and fuzzy feeling of solving a single 
problem for a single person when nobody else knows what I managed to 
accomplish does not further my career nor does it pay my bills -- while 
a public discussion not only offers the possibility that other people 
than you might benefit from my advice (which would in turn help me), but 
also offers the possibility that other people might help you, relieving 
me.

I really wish that more people were trying to help the OpenSPIM 
community thrive as a publicly visible community. There are some 
laudable examples on the OpenSPIM mailing list recently, and I am very 
thankful for that.

Please note that it is not obvious from your screenshots what amount of 
memory Fiji *actually* reserves. Two Fiji instances running side by 
side, for example, will not have the same amount of memory available 
because Java works by reserving the memory at start-up, and that memory 
is then not available to a second Fiji instance. The ImageJ launcher 
will detect that less memory is available than it was asked to ask for 
and fall back to try with a lesser amount. That is my guess regarding 
what happens on your computer.

By clicking on the status bar, you will see how much memory Fiji's Java 
VM thinks is available. Clicking on the status bar will also trigger a 
so-called "garbage collection", i.e. it will ask the Java VM to 
re-organize its memory consumption. Therefore, sporadically clicking on 
the status bar while the plugin is running might even work around the 
memory issue.

You really scared me when you said that it crashed. You see, "to crash" 
means one very specific thing, and that thing only, when you talk about 
computer programs: it means that the entire application just stopped to 
run, all its windows vanished, without any error message nor a chance to 
store so-far unsaved data.

That is distinctly not what happened. What you saw is an 
OutOfMemoryException which stopped the plugin but nothing else.

It might make sense to open large images in that Fiji instance first, 
until it runs out of memory, in order to determine whether the problem 
lies with the Java VM in general, or with the plugin you are trying to 
run. I am getting the impression that something is wrong with your Fiji 
installation rather than with the SPIM Registration plugin.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi,

I put together a time line that visualizes the log file I sent with the 
first email (single slice no stage movement).
 From this I learn that it somehow takes 300 ms to acquire 1 image with 
an exposure time of 100 ms. After that it takes an additional 250 ms 
until the laser is told to turn off. That is ~400 ms unaccounted for.
As I mentioned  I still don't understand why the stage is even engaged 
and the laser power  is queried during acquisition.

As mentioned I can record a time series at full camera frame rate with 
Micromanager alone. No problem whatsoever.

I am using "Profile acquisition" in the SPIM plugin.
I will try to get the results from the Flight Recorder of Java Mission 
Control.

But we are talking about acquiring a time series, will all the motors 
unchecked in the plugin, so all the movements are 0 steps by definition. 
So it's just the communication with the motors that takes 150 ms, not 
any physical movement:

---

I suppose there are two questions, both to somebody with a better 
understanding of Micromanager than I:
1. Why is the communication so slow? (Same goes for Robert's laser)
2. Why does the communication with the motors take place if the distance 
to move is 0? Is this a bug, or is the plugin designed like that? How 
hard would it be to change?

(I'm looking at the code trying to figure out the answer to 2, but I 
don't see it yet)

Monika

Hi,

just for your information - just now the strategy of using  
Fiji+Micro-manager-dev+Openspim is not perfect. The Micro-manager-dev  
update site is not updating since 30.04., and this version has some  
conflicts with the newest version of Fiji, so there might be errors. Below  
the response I got from Micromanager that hopefully explains this better.

(I found about this because I tried to use the Micro-Manager  
Multi-Dimensional Acquisition and I was getting an exception when trying  
to save a stack).

Regards,
Monika

The conflict is in other JARs. We still use an outdated version of
scifio.jar, which conflicts with the newer version in Fiji. We fully
intend to fix this, and it will hopefully not be too hard, but it is not
trivial (we need to make sure we don't introduce issues into file saving
in our official release, and that will require careful testing).

Please consider the Micro-Manager-dev update site to be experimental.

I don't think there is an easy fix at this moment that can be done by
just replacing JARs. We'll keep working on it!

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <D17FCA7F.43253%mredd@cores.utah.edu>

I have discovered a problem with micromanager 1.4.22 and the Orca ER. When I take a z-stack the resulting images are split. The left 1/3 of the image is fused to the right 2/3. The problem has something to to do with the Picard stage as taking 10 images quickly without stage movement results in intact images. Taking images of multiple xy positions results in split images. I replaced the Orca ER and associated control box with another Orca ER setup and the problem persisted.  I reinstalled an earlier version of micromanager (1.4.19) and the problem went away. Are earlier versions of Openspim software archived somewhere? I would like to download a version with mm 1.4.19.

Cheers

Hello Aryeh,

At the time we were using a Hamamatsu Orca ER, which is firewire based, hence the need for a computer with a firewire port. A portable laptop computer is a nice thing to have, but not necessary. 

Nowadays we cover many more models of camera, and I would personally suggest that you buy a sCMOS due to their larger field of view and improved speed.  

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Pete,

> sCMOS due to their larger field of view and improved speed.
Since I am having this issue with speed: Would you mind profiling 
("profile acquisition") and sending me the result of a 10 frame long 
time series (100ms exposure) recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta 
all unchecked and  without "Update Live preview".

That would be great!

Robert

Very good -- in this case we have many options, especially with USB3.0.

Howdy Robert,

Can you tell me exactly how you do your tests?! I can repeat them with an Orca ER and an Andor Neo sCMOS, but I want to make sure that it'll be done right.

Regards,
Pete

Hi Pete,

Since I am having this issue with speed: Would you mind profiling 
("profile acquisition") and sending me the result of a 10 frame long 
time series (100ms exposure) recorded to memory with X/Y/Z Stage/Theta 
all unchecked and  without "Update Live preview".

That would be great!

Robert

Hello, 

A couple questions from newbie.  Has anyone who works with zebrafish tried gentle perfusion in the little chambers, say using fine needles and a syringe pump?  Adding drugs or refreshing medium during imaging could be quite useful.  

Separately, If anyone is using openSPIM with two lasers or more I would be grateful to talk off-list about how you implemented it.  

Thanks and all the best,

I would like to encourage a more open discussion. This is the OpenSPIM 
project, after all, and it seems pretty obvious to me that the project 
would benefit more from a discussion *on* this list than from a 
discussion in private.

Ciao,

This bug has been fixed now: it was a bug in the command-line version of 
the updater (that is used in Micro-Manager's automatic population of the 
update site from its nightly builds), and that bug was exposed by a 
faulty upload of the xml-apis.jar to the ImageJ update site itself.

I have fixed both, and uploaded the fixed updater on Friday; As of 
yesterday (Saturday), things are groovy again.

Hi Aryeh,

We have just recently finished the build of a dual side illumination system using the lighthub-6 with 3 laser lines. I will upload pictures and details within next coming weeks on the wiki page. The first point is to go for the lighthub-6 since the price difference is very small. This will allow an expansion in the future with more lasers. The fiber is coupled to a fiber collimator fixed to a holder on a rail to allow for alignment with the beam splitter. Today I would have built it with a small xz stage for improved alignment or at least a sturdier holder of the collimator. There are some examples at Thorlabs. I have added the links to the details that we used in the current setup. It is important to get a good fixation of the collimator especially if you like to use the laser module in other microscopes and regularly shifts the fiber. 

I hope this will help you!

SPIMers,

We have completed a multichannel AOTF modulated 4 line L-SPIM.  We took an AOTF and three retired lasers(442,488,514,568,647) from our spinning disk and designed a DAC based on the Arduino DAC supported by micromanager (the 442 is not quite integrated optically).  We've also incorporated an emission filter wheel and excitation wheel for beam characterizing (the former is integrated in our branch of the SPIMAcquisition plugin).  I plan to have the optics/hardware/software design and example datasets up on the OpenSPIM site in the coming weeks-grant taking precedent.  I'm working with Johannes to get our branch of SPIMAcquisition merged with the release version-waiting on me really.

On the perfusion and environmental control side, we have a summer student that is working on these aspects for our system.  The perfusion is going to be fairly rudimentary.  We will be relying on peristaltic pumps because the volume of our sample chamber is so large (7 ml).  The perfusion system will be setup to work as a recirculating loop as well to deliver dissolved gases CO2 etc as required-via a simple bubbler.  If I can find a CO2 sensor I like(cost to performance) this might be integrated into the bubbler unit.

I'm not crazy about directly heating the chamber with amped up resistors, so we're starting with a "closed-loop" heated reservoir, re-circulator and heat-exchanger-if it works well we may also strap a Peltier based heat pump to the reservoir as well to give us cooling.

In toto there will be a handful of peristaltic pumps, controllers (Arduino as PIDs), media bubblers and heated reservoirs.  As time permits we'll be writing a plugin for micromanager to wrangle all this functionality and add graphs etc-everything you might want out of a comparable Peco or Okolabs solution.

As we make progress I'll update our  to-be-completed OpenSPIM page.
Happy SPIMing!

Seth

Dear Aryeh,

rolling shutter gives you twice the speed, but potential artifacts caused by the time offset across the frame. There are cameras which give you both shutter modes (Andor Zyla etc.), if you are willing to give up some QE. It really depends on your specimen, and what kind of analysis you want to do. Unless you want to quantify rapid movements across the frame (e.g. fast fluidics), I would say rolling shutter is fine.

Best,
Michael
