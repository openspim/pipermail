<PRE>Hi Luke,

I re-Cc:ed the list because I feel it to be inappropriate to keep this
conversation a secret from our collaborators.

Not really, *iff* we wait until Mark switches their HEAD to 2010, and
*iff* you simply delete all of our changes to .vcxproj files.

Right. That's what I meant by: our work was basically wasting time because
we cannot continue to use those changes.

Unless you disagree, let's focus more on early collaboration on things
that are not specific to OpenSPIM.

&gt;<i> While we're on the topic of the build system, I wanted to run an idea

</I>&gt;<i> 'press F7 to build it all', it would make sense to do this.)
</I>
I agree. The easier it is to build it all, the better. Remember: I want
Jenkins to build this thing eventually.

Ciao,
Dscho
