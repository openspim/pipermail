<PRE>Hello,

My name is Luke Stuyvenberg; I'm a programmer for the OpenSPIM project (<A HREF="http://www.openspim.org">http://www.openspim.org</A> and the <A HREF="http://openspim.org/mailman/listinfo/openspim">openspim at openspim.org</A> mailing list).

We've actually been working on this task separately as well, and I was thinking some of our work might be of use to you. You can see the current state of our code at <A HREF="http://github.com/openspim/micromanager">http://github.com/openspim/micromanager</A> -- I believe the project files are based off of Micro-Manager 1.4.13 or so (from the source code available roughly 2 months ago). I should note that our directory structure is somewhat different from vanilla Micro-Manager; for instance, we copy our device adapters to Fiji.app/mm/$(Platform) rather than the executable directory; additionally, because of our basis in Fiji, some other paths may not be entirely accurate.


At present, I've successfully built MMCore, MMCoreJ_wrap, and mmstudio (using the ant build file) from VS2010 Express (and also using msbuild from the command line), as well as several of the device adapters needed for our project -- CoherentCube and PicardStage specifically; also SerialManager and DemoCamera for good measure. (I've also built many of the other device adapters, but the aforementioned ones are most commonly built, being central to our project.) If you'd like to incorporate any of our work, or if we can be of any other assistance in this task, please don't hesitate to let us know!


Sincerely,
Luke Stuyvenberg


P.S. I have a few plans to work on VS2012 support as time arises; if in the future that work may also be helpful, feel free to write myself and our mailing list.
