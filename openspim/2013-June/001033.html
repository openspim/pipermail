<PRE>Hi Mark,

(Whoops; we lost the mailing list.)

I had expected it might be the case that a merge wouldn't be viable, but thanks for the heads-up just the same. We were actually planning to rebase soon to pick up the changes for x64; given how close you seem to be to finishing the VS2010 project files, I think we'll hold off on that until you've finished. I'll also be looking forward to the changes they bring; managing the output paths has been something of an issue for us in the past.


Thanks,
Luke

You can see the current state of our code at <A HREF="http://github.com/openspim/micromanager">http://github.com/openspim/micromanager</A> -- I believe the project files are based off of Micro-Manager 1.4.13 or so (from the source code available roughly 2 months ago).

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for this note. The Core and the device adaptors without external dependencies have not presented much of a problem, and most of the work has been getting the device adapters to build against external libraries. I have pretty much gotten everything working except for the most recently added device adapters (which I simply haven't gotten around to yet).

</I>&gt;<i> The VS2008 project files have undergone quite a bit of cleanup over the past month and a half, and I'll be merging more of that before switching the SVN head to VS2010, so if you intend to keep tracking the official SVN repo, I'm afraid you might have to discard your version (even with git, I don't think it will be practical to merge). I am also moving common settings to property sheets, though, so setting up things like different copy destination paths should become easier.
