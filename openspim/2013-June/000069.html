We lost the mailing lists on this reply; I've let Mark know, but on the off chance he deliberately left them out of the communication, I haven't re-included micro-manager's (only our own).

Like I said. merge -s 'ours'. But I have to disagree with what you said in IRC -- our work wasn't wasted; though our project files will likely be replaced by those put out by Mark, things like the new build script (which couldn't have been developed with '08) are still valuable, an in fact will probably require minimal changes to work with the new project files.


Either way, though, our rebase is going to be painful. Personally, I'd like to suggest we just accept Micro-Manager's changes to all vcxproj and sln files (or not apply any of our own, as the case may be), then fix our build when the dust settles. It isn't ideal, but at least this way we have a well-defined conflict resolution for those files...


While we're on the topic of the build system, I wanted to run an idea past you -- that is, adding VS projects for the Micro-Manager plugins and acquisition engine.

Let me know what you think.
