<PRE>Hi Alexis,

</I>&gt;<i> Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Native Module failed to load
</I>
This might be the &quot;new&quot; error message instead of the old &quot;core property is
read-only&quot; red herring. In our FAQ, we describe the real reason:

<A HREF="http://openspim.org/FAQ#I_get_the_error_that_a_core_property_is_read-only.3F">http://openspim.org/FAQ#I_get_the_error_that_a_core_property_is_read-only.3F</A>

It is simply a mismatch between the memory management of the device
adapter layer and the Java memory management: Fiji tries to grab as much
memory as possible, not leaving enough for the Hamamatsu driver. So: just
go to Edit&gt;Options&gt;Memory &amp; Threads and limit the RAM to leave enough
space for the low-level driver.

&gt;<i> What is really surprising is that the same device Adapter works
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly (camera is operated and live stream works) when run into a
</I>&gt;<i> 'standalone' MicroManager (tested: latest nightly build, v1.4.13 and
</I>&gt;<i> v1.4.14). Therefore it seems that the issue resides into the MM version
</I>&gt;<i> embedded into OpenSPIM (and/or that I am running Windows 7).
</I>
Yep, this is the tell-tale for the memory problem described above.
Unfortunately, we did not get the Hamamatsu people to provide a sensible
error message, and the driver is closed source, so we really cannot do
anything about it.

&gt;<i> &gt; I can't make any certain statements about support for Windows 7,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unfortunately, since our goal at present is to maximize support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows XP first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to downgrade to windows XP is  something I have tried at the very
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after
</I>&gt;<i> hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the
</I>&gt;<i> medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenSPIM). 
</I>
Fair enough. You'll probably not be the only person to have that problem,
so I'd appreciate you helping us to get the software working on Windows 7,
too.

&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding the development environment, I'm actively working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bringing it up-to-date, and your assistance in this would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; invaluable -- I was hoping you might test something for me: Please try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downloading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and installing it. This is a newer version of the installer, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hopefully should at least finish putting everything into place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for this. I am certainly willing/wanting to serve as your
</I>&gt;<i> guinea-pig for this. Idiot-testing  is always useful. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then
</I>&gt;<i> I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am motivated to get this to work, so please involve me. 
</I>
Thank you so much! We really need this to work for all people willing to
contribute, and solving the obstacles you face will help that.

I take it you already have Visual Express Studio installed? If so, which
one? And do you you see the file

	C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/Common7/IDE/VCExpress.exe

or similar?

Ciao,
Johannes
