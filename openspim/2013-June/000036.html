<PRE>Hi Luke,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the difference, as Johannes mentioned, is Fiji's approach to memory usage. OpenSPIM uses the Fiji loader, which is generally greedy about memory, where (if I recall correctly) plain ImageJ (which the standalone MicroManager software runs off of) is more conservative. Specifying a sensible memory limit in Fiji should resolve the issue -- though oddly, I still get it the first time I start OpenSPIM after a reboot. Please let me know if you encounter the same issue.
</I>
Indeed, limiting the amount of RAM solved the issue. I am quite happy to see that everything is now running. So in principle, Windows7 seems to be supported. 
However, I realised that our laser (Cobolt) does not appear into the list of available  Shutter. Any idea of what could go wrong? I can turn it  ON/OFF using the Device/Properties editor of MM.

Now let's try to do real stuff with this device :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> Trying to downgrade to windows XP is something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree completely; it would be excellent to get this software running on Windows 7 -- moreover, I aim to support x64. Now that Micro-Manager has released a 64-bit version, this is looking promising, though I have the suspicion it will entail another rebase.
</I>
I only used 32bits versions so far. I'll test a 64bits versions when available.

&gt;<i> Yes, this is the error the startup script provides when it doesn't find Visual C++ Express. Unfortunately, the script's current detection is limited to checking 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe' for existence -- meaning it expects an entirely normal hard drive setup and default VC Express installation. I hope to have an updated version of the script (and, with luck, perhaps another new installer) available in a few hours which will be considerably more flexible in its detection (hopefully, it will find and use VC Express 2008/2010 wherever it is installed, but in the worst case, you can change the aforementioned location by editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh -- right at the top we tell it where to look).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've uploaded the new installer to <A HREF="http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130604.exe">http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130604.exe</A> -- please give it a try after installing Visual C++ Express 2010. (I believe this is going to become the requirement for the OpenSPIM project -- the '08 project files are quickly falling into disrepair, both ours and those included with Micro-Manager.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I do have Visual C++ Express installed (2010). It resides on C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe

Thanks for the latest installer. But it hangs at the same points, after unzipping, the same command prompt. If I understood correctly, this self-executing archive should install a Git environment, and perform a clone of the OpenSPIM repository. In my case, after unzipping nothing happen, no Git active, no cloning,  only the ~19Mb of the archive are installed (see screenshot). Am I missing something?

Thanks for the tip on how to hack the /src/micromanager/openspim.sh, I will give it a shot from the source code I have 'manually' fetched from  Git.

best,

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your help!
