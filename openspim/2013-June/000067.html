<PRE>I will expand the section 

<A HREF="http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#What_beads_to_use.3F">http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#What_beads_to_use.3F</A>

on the bead selection. It is a complex problem with three variables, the strength of your signal, the laser power and the properties of your emission filter (band-pass versus long-pass). I recommend to get several wavelengths of beads and experiment with your particular conditions. I can provide some guidelines for His-YFP.

That the lines come from beads came as a surprise to me. This is most likely caused by the fact that they are too large, i.e. not sub resolution. Bright beads can be a little disturbing but I have never seen anything like that.

All the best
