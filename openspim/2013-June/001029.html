That is some nice contrast! How many slices did you max-project?

Also, as I told Julie on her way out: we absolutely have to use
off-frequency beads. Our signal is too delicate to be overlaid by beads
having a field day.

This might need some changes on the Wiki to make it *very clear* that you
should *never* use beads that are excited by exactly the wavelength of the
laser.

The page people will read first (if they read any documentation at all,
that is), is certainly <A HREF="http://openspim.org/Operation">http://openspim.org/Operation</A> (and it does not
mention the wavelength issue at all). There *is* a section hidden in
<A HREF="http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation">http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation</A> about that, but
it is unlikely that this page is what people read *before* they image
their samples and see super-bright beads triggering the full-moon effect.

It would be nice, for example, if maybe people from Dresden could
expand that section, move it to its own page, document there which
particular beads worked for them (to give a good idea what beads might
work for others, too), and then link to that page from all the appropriate
places.

Hmm?

Ciao,
Johannes
