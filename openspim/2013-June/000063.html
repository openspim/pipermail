<PRE>Hi Pavel &amp; Johannes (and everyone),

&gt;<i> Nice work. What are the thick, bright, white lines in the image?
</I>

The thick lines are flares from tremendously overbright beads.We used 20um beads for this sample, as we were having trouble getting a clean solution of .2um beads. Too much light from the 20um beads gave our Orca's detector a hard time.

&gt;<i> That is some nice contrast! How many slices did you max-project?
</I>

It varies between the images, I believe between 100 and 200 slices.

&gt;<i> Also, as I told Julie on her way out: we absolutely have to use
</I>&gt;<i> off-frequency beads. Our signal is too delicate to be overlaid by beads
</I>&gt;<i> having a field day.
</I>

I agree. Before we finished imaging, Julie decided to work with the red beads on Monday; next Thursday we should be able to put together some samples with weaker beads.
 
&gt;<i> This might need some changes on the Wiki to make it *very clear* that you
</I>&gt;<i> should *never* use beads that are excited by exactly the wavelength of the
</I>&gt;<i> laser.
</I>

I should point out that these are 20um beads causing the flares. It's possible that sub-resolution beads (even those specifically excited by our laser) won't have the same dramatic effect as these. In other words '*never*' might be a bit overzealous; I'm sure there are times when operators would like a very strong bead signal.

&gt;<i> The page people will read first (if they read any documentation at all,
</I>&gt;<i> that is), is certainly <A HREF="http://openspim.org/Operation">http://openspim.org/Operation</A> (and it does not
</I>&gt;<i> mention the wavelength issue at all). There *is* a section hidden in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation">http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation</A> about that, but
</I>&gt;<i> it is unlikely that this page is what people read *before* they image
</I>&gt;<i> their samples and see super-bright beads triggering the full-moon effect.
</I>

I agree, of course. It's naive to hope people would read our suggestions for sample prep; I imagine they have a protocol they're already familiar with.
 
&gt;<i> It would be nice, for example, if maybe people from Dresden could
</I>&gt;<i> expand that section, move it to its own page, document there which
</I>&gt;<i> particular beads worked for them (to give a good idea what beads might
</I>&gt;<i> work for others, too), and then link to that page from all the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> places.
</I>
We can probably add a note to the sample prep section on the Operation page, with a link to a page about which beads we've found work well.

Thanks,
Luke

</PRE>
