Given that Dresden had substantial problems even with sub-resolution
beads, I would actually wager a bet that &quot;never&quot; is the correct adjective
here: I highly doubt that any non-toxic amounts of fluorophores translated
from reporter genes would come even close to the amount of fluorophores
present even in the tiniest sub-resolution beads made by humans.

In any case, the idea of OpenSPIM is to make things easier by sharing
knowledge, right? So even if I'd lose my bet, it would be the appropriate
thing to share the insight that non-off-color beads *were* too bright in
our case.

Ciao,
Johannes
