<PRE>Hello Luke,
thanks a bunch for the precise and helpful message. 
I only had the opportunity to do  some tests today and it revealed quite frustrating:  

&gt;<i> If you fully update your OpenSPIM installation (Help -&gt; Update Fiji), when you launch Micro-Manager it should register as 'v1.4.x dev' (I believe the code was between 1.4.13 and 1.4.14).
</I>
First, I had (stupidly) never thought about upgrading the OpenSPIM's Fiji. Indeed, now the MM version is &quot;1.4.x dev&quot; 	 

&gt;<i> I just tested now (Windows XP, freshly up-to-date OpenSPIM-20130131.zip, with an Orca R^2), and the software can load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll file included in the latest MM nightly build
</I>
Indeed it can now load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll
Unfortunately, it still can not communicate properly with the Camera (OrcaFlash4). The errors messages I get are:
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Error code 40 (28 hex)
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Native Module failed to load

What is really surprising is that the same device Adapter works perfectly (camera is operated and live stream works) when run into a 'standalone' MicroManager (tested: latest nightly build, v1.4.13 and v1.4.14). Therefore it seems that the issue resides into the MM version embedded into OpenSPIM (and/or that I am running Windows 7).

&gt;<i> I can't make any certain statements about support for Windows 7, unfortunately, since our goal at present is to maximize support for Windows XP first.
</I>
Trying to downgrade to windows XP is  something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 

&gt;<i> Regarding the development environment, I'm actively working on bringing it up-to-date, and your assistance in this would be invaluable -- I was hoping you might test something for me: Please try downloading <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe</A> and installing it. This is a newer version of the installer, and hopefully should at least finish putting everything into place.
</I>
Thanks for this. I am certainly willing/wanting to serve as your guinea-pig for this. Idiot-testing  is always useful. 

Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point. 

I am motivated to get this to work, so please involve me. 

With my best regards,

Alexis
