Dear Dr. Jan

My is John from Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore. Our lab is in the process of setting up the Open SPIM. Can I please find out the height and thickness of the light sheet created by the Open SPIM setup?

It will also be very helpful if images of both the height and thickness of the light sheet can be posted on the Open SPIM web site. Those images will serve as useful reference as we setup the Open SPIM in the lab.

Best Regards,
John

Hello Luke,
thanks a bunch for the precise and helpful message. 
I only had the opportunity to do  some tests today and it revealed quite frustrating:  

> If you fully update your OpenSPIM installation (Help -> Update Fiji), when you launch Micro-Manager it should register as 'v1.4.x dev' (I believe the code was between 1.4.13 and 1.4.14).

First, I had (stupidly) never thought about upgrading the OpenSPIM's Fiji. Indeed, now the MM version is "1.4.x dev" 	 

> I just tested now (Windows XP, freshly up-to-date OpenSPIM-20130131.zip, with an Orca R^2), and the software can load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll file included in the latest MM nightly build

Indeed it can now load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll
Unfortunately, it still can not communicate properly with the Camera (OrcaFlash4). The errors messages I get are:
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Error code 40 (28 hex)
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Native Module failed to load

What is really surprising is that the same device Adapter works perfectly (camera is operated and live stream works) when run into a 'standalone' MicroManager (tested: latest nightly build, v1.4.13 and v1.4.14). Therefore it seems that the issue resides into the MM version embedded into OpenSPIM (and/or that I am running Windows 7).

> I can't make any certain statements about support for Windows 7, unfortunately, since our goal at present is to maximize support for Windows XP first.

Trying to downgrade to windows XP is  something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 

> Regarding the development environment, I'm actively working on bringing it up-to-date, and your assistance in this would be invaluable -- I was hoping you might test something for me: Please try downloading https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe and installing it. This is a newer version of the installer, and hopefully should at least finish putting everything into place.

Thanks for this. I am certainly willing/wanting to serve as your guinea-pig for this. Idiot-testing  is always useful. 

Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point. 

I am motivated to get this to work, so please involve me. 

With my best regards,

Alexis

Dear John,

The lightsheet with the stated optics is around 7-10 um. We are working on a lightsheet thickness
calculator that we will put on the wiki as soon as it it finished.

Thank you for your understanding in advance.

Hi Pete,

I thought maybe you need yet another distraction. So I added the link to
the MSIM project to our Links:

	http://openspim.org/Links#Other_Open_Access_projects

In the paper
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462167/?report=reader#!po=65.9091
they have a link to the supplemental material
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462167/bin/NIHMS397910-supplement-1.pdf
whose figure 3 shows their setup.

I do not know what you are up to these days, but maybe you want to look at
that and figure out whether there is an easy way to modify the OpenSPIM
1.0 hardware to support that mode?

Ciao,
Johannes

To enhance on that comment until the time when Dr Jan chimes in, this is
how we measure the light-sheet thickness: we use the same mirror as for
the light-sheet calibration described here:

	http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration

(unfortunately, the description of the last steps of that page have not
yet been completed.)

In the last steps, what we do is to use an improvised transmission light
(we really use a reading light and shine that through the sample chamber)
to get the mirror into focus both with the transmission light and the
light-sheet by having the mirror (also called grid on the page because it
is a gridded mirror) at 45 degrees such that the light-sheet is reflected
directly into the camera.

At that stage, the light-sheet thickness can be measured exactly by
calibrating the pixel spacing with the known grid spacing and the simply
counting the number of pixels of the width (because the light-sheet is now
directed directly into the camera, parallel to the detection axis).

The height of the light-sheet is configurable to a certain extent: you can
make it narrower or larger by adjusting the iris in the last part of the
illumination axis. Of course, you still want it to be relatively uniform
over the height; we found it reasonable uniform in the field of view we
use (and we made it a little larger than that). Although I have to admit
that we never came around to *really* quantify this.

Ciao,
Johannes

This might be the "new" error message instead of the old "core property is
read-only" red herring. In our FAQ, we describe the real reason:

http://openspim.org/FAQ#I_get_the_error_that_a_core_property_is_read-only.3F

It is simply a mismatch between the memory management of the device
adapter layer and the Java memory management: Fiji tries to grab as much
memory as possible, not leaving enough for the Hamamatsu driver. So: just
go to Edit>Options>Memory & Threads and limit the RAM to leave enough
space for the low-level driver.

Yep, this is the tell-tale for the memory problem described above.
Unfortunately, we did not get the Hamamatsu people to provide a sensible
error message, and the driver is closed source, so we really cannot do
anything about it.

Fair enough. You'll probably not be the only person to have that problem,
so I'd appreciate you helping us to get the software working on Windows 7,
too.

Thank you so much! We really need this to work for all people willing to
contribute, and solving the obstacles you face will help that.

I take it you already have Visual Express Studio installed? If so, which
one? And do you you see the file

	C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/Common7/IDE/VCExpress.exe

or similar?

Therefore it seems that the issue resides into the MM version embedded into OpenSPIM (and/or that I am running Windows 7).



I think the difference, as Johannes mentioned, is Fiji's approach to memory usage. OpenSPIM uses the Fiji loader, which is generally greedy about memory, where (if I recall correctly) plain ImageJ (which the standalone MicroManager software runs off of) is more conservative. Specifying a sensible memory limit in Fiji should resolve the issue -- though oddly, I still get it the first time I start OpenSPIM after a reboot. Please let me know if you encounter the same issue.


> Trying to downgrade to windows XP is something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM).?



I agree completely; it would be excellent to get this software running on Windows 7 -- moreover, I aim to support x64. Now that Micro-Manager has released a 64-bit version, this is looking promising, though I have the suspicion it will entail another rebase.


> Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point.?



Yes, this is the error the startup script provides when it doesn't find Visual C++ Express. Unfortunately, the script's current detection is limited to checking 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe' for existence -- meaning it expects an entirely normal hard drive setup and default VC Express installation. I hope to have an updated version of the script (and, with luck, perhaps another new installer) available in a few hours which will be considerably more flexible in its detection (hopefully, it will find and use VC Express 2008/2010 wherever it is installed, but in the worst case, you can change the aforementioned location by editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh -- right at the top we tell it where to look).


Thank you for your help!

Hey Alexis,

I've uploaded the new installer to http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130604.exe -- please give it a try after installing Visual C++ Express 2010. (I believe this is going to become the requirement for the OpenSPIM project -- the '08 project files are quickly falling into disrepair, both ours and those included with Micro-Manager.)


Thanks again!
Luke Stuyvenberg

Please let me know if you encounter the same issue.

Indeed, limiting the amount of RAM solved the issue. I am quite happy to see that everything is now running. So in principle, Windows7 seems to be supported. 
However, I realised that our laser (Cobolt) does not appear into the list of available  Shutter. Any idea of what could go wrong? I can turn it  ON/OFF using the Device/Properties editor of MM.

Now let's try to do real stuff with this device :-)

(I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM).

I only used 32bits versions so far. I'll test a 64bits versions when available.

> Yes, this is the error the startup script provides when it doesn't find Visual C++ Express. Unfortunately, the script's current detection is limited to checking 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe' for existence -- meaning it expects an entirely normal hard drive setup and default VC Express installation. I hope to have an updated version of the script (and, with luck, perhaps another new installer) available in a few hours which will be considerably more flexible in its detection (hopefully, it will find and use VC Express 2008/2010 wherever it is installed, but in the worst case, you can change the aforementioned location by editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh -- right at the top we tell it where to look).

I do have Visual C++ Express installed (2010). It resides on C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe

Thanks for the latest installer. But it hangs at the same points, after unzipping, the same command prompt. If I understood correctly, this self-executing archive should install a Git environment, and perform a clone of the OpenSPIM repository. In my case, after unzipping nothing happen, no Git active, no cloning,  only the ~19Mb of the archive are installed (see screenshot). Am I missing something?

Thanks for the tip on how to hack the /src/micromanager/openspim.sh, I will give it a shot from the source code I have 'manually' fetched from  Git.

best,

Hi Alexis,

I just looked into this, and it seems the developers of the Cobolt device adapter didn't make the device a shutter -- as a result, it won't appear in the shutter list. I don't want to alter this myself just yet, for fear of stepping on the author's toes -- see?http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Cobolt?for details.
Unfortunately, this will present problems with the OpenSPIM software, which expects a shutter device and might refuse to function without one. (At the very least, it should give you a warning.)
You might try asking the Micro-Manager mailing list, or Karl Bellve (the DAL's author) in particular, if there are plans to implement this behavior. Or, if you're feeling ambitious, once we have your development environment working, you may wish to make the changes yourself and contribute them to Micro-Manager.


> I only used 32bits versions so far. I'll test a 64bits versions when available.
I appreciate the volunteering! I'm hoping to have the rebase done before the month is over; I'll try to keep the mailing list informed.


> I do have Visual C++ Express installed (2010). It resides on C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe
Yes, the old installer wouldn't have checked for (x86), because it's not expecting to be run on a 64-bit system; it probably wouldn't have found the IDE. The new installer was supposed to fix this, but...


> Thanks for the latest installer. But it hangs at the same points, after unzipping, the same command prompt. If I understood correctly, this self-executing archive should install a Git environment, and perform a clone of the OpenSPIM repository. In my case, after unzipping nothing happen, no Git active, no cloning, only the ~19Mb of the archive are installed (see screenshot). Am I missing something?
When it hangs, do you mean it gives you the missing VC Express error? Or does it actually, physically stop doing anything?
In the former case, it means there's a problem with detecting VC Express. Using regedit, please check the following registry keys:
- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VCExpress.DTE\CurVer (the default value should have something like "VCExpress.DTE.10.0")
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VCExpress\10.0\InstallDir (it should match the path you gave me above)
These two keys are used to piece together the path to VC Express. If either is missing or incorrect, the script won't continue and will give you the message from earlier. Please let me know if there are any problems with these registry settings; I'm trying to make the startup script as general as possible, so knowing, for example, that not everyone may have a VCExpress.DTE entry is very helpful.


> Thanks for the tip on how to hack the /src/micromanager/openspim.sh, I will give it a shot from the source code I have 'manually' fetched from Git.


This still should be possible after the latest update: line 27 of openspim.sh should set the VCEXPRESS path. If you replace everything between the double-quotes with, for example, "C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\VCExpress.exe", it should work.


Thanks again,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Alexis,

I've once again updated the development environment installer, with what I hope will be a more reliable detection of VC Express. If the hang-up in the installer you mentioned is because it can't find VC Express, and editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh doesn't resolve the problem, please:


- Delete C:\openspim-dev-env (or choose to install to a different directory)
- Delete C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\bin\vcexpress.sh (this may contain incorrect information)
- Download http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130605.exe (and install it)


Thanks, and let me know if you encounter any problems!
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Luke,

>> However, I realised that our laser (Cobolt) does not appear into the list of available Shutter. Any idea of what could go wrong? I can turn it ON/OFF using the Device/Properties editor of MM.
> I just looked into this, and it seems the developers of the Cobolt device adapter didn't make the device a shutter -- as a result, it won't appear in the shutter list. I don't want to alter this myself just yet, for fear of stepping on the author's toes -- seehttp://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Cobolt for details.
> Unfortunately, this will present problems with the OpenSPIM software, which expects a shutter device and might refuse to function without one. (At the very least, it should give you a warning.)
> You might try asking the Micro-Manager mailing list, or Karl Bellve (the DAL's author) in particular, if there are plans to implement this behavior. Or, if you're feeling ambitious, once we have your development environment working, you may wish to make the changes yourself and contribute them to Micro-Manager.

I do not mind altering the code myself. I have actually already  fixed and recompiled the code of this device adapter to squash a nasty line ending bug that was impeding proper commands to be sent on Windows. The bug had been here for ages but apparently that device adapter is not heavily used on Windows and I was the first one to notice it. Karl and I have committed the changes to MM code base.
  
I have been already  in contact with Karl so I can liaise with him to see if he objects to me adding the shutter feature.    

The 64'000$ question: how do I make a device a shutter? Can you point me to the appropriate documentation or code example? Although I have only limited C coding experience, the Cobolt device adapter code is definitively something in my league.

With my best regards,

Alexis

Hi Johannes,

Stephan Preibisch and myself will present a workshop on SPIMage processing at the conference. I talked about OpenSPIM at this meeting last year. It will be implicitly mentioned during the tutorials.

In other words this conference, which I started in Dresden - remember?, is covered.

All the best

Here is the sequence of event: 
	- I double click the OpenSPIM-dev-env-XXXX.exe 
	- I pick the folder where to install
	- The 7z unarchiver unpacks the ~200Mb of files. (see screenshot for the content of the folder where things are extracted) 
	- The Command prompt requesting for VCExpress installation appears (other screenshot).
	- I close the terminal window. Nothing else happens.

 I indeed have the correct path in this entry.
 
> - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VCExpress.DTE\CurVer (the default value should have something like "VCExpress.DTE.10.0")

Nothing at that location; however, I found it at:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\VCExpress.DTE\CurVer  and indeed contains "VCExpress.DTE.10.0"

With my best regards,

Alexis

I *think* all you have to do is extend the CShutterBase class:
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/DeviceAdapters/DemoCamera/DemoCamera.h#L695

(instead of CGenericBase:
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/DeviceAdapters/Cobolt/Cobolt.h#L30)

Ah, so it is not a "hang" but more like: it does not do anything else than
wait for your user input.

>From your second screenshot, it looks as if the error is:

	bash: reg: command not found

And the culprit is of course:

	https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/openspim.sh#L12

Seems that the "reg" tool is not as universally present as we originally
thought!

So can you please do the following:

- overwrite the file openspim.sh in your OpenSPIM-Dev-Env's etc/profile.d/
  subdirectory with this:

	https://raw.github.com/openspim/micromanager/for-alexis/openspim.sh

- start the "git-bash" Batch file in your OpenSPIM-Dev-Env

It should now do many, many more things than just complain about the
absence of Visual C++...

Once you report that it is working, I will make this part of the 'master'
branch and make a new dev-env installer.

Thanks!

I suspect you'll also have to implement some specific member functions -- DemoCamera is a reasonable source, though I'd suggest using CoherentCube's DeviceAdapter for reference -- it doesn't contain code for a camera, and is more relevant to laser controllers. A quick overview of what I think will need changing:
- Cobolt.h line 30: change CGenericBase<Cobolt> to CShutterBase<Cobolt>
- Cobolt.h: add shutter API calls (see CoherentCube.h lines 153 - 156)
- Cobolt.cpp: Implement the shutter API functions -- probably, they will just call LaserOnOff with the right value.

Oops! Sorry; I don't yet have a Win7 machine/VM to test on, so I wasn't aware of this. tclsh is included in our dev env package, so I suppose we'd best switch to that. Thanks Johannes for the substitute.


Please let us know how the tests go!


Thanks again,

Hi Luke,

I have used CoherentCube's as a template and modified the Cobolt code to implement the Shutter API. 
It compiles seamlessly. 
However, OpenSPIM now complains about this new device adapter: "Version Mismatch" (and list it as  "unavailable").

I assume that I use the wrong code base; but I must confess I am now totally lost. Given that my version of OpenSPIM utilises MM v1.4.xx Dev, which MM source code version should I use? 

Alexis

Is there a chance that you fork https://github.com/openspim/micromanager
and push your changes there? That would make it a bit easier to analyze
the situation on my side...

Hi Alexis,

The error message seems to confirm your assumption; it suggests that one of the files Cobolt depends on is out-of-date. (I suspect this file is most likely /src/micromanager/MMDevice/DeviceBase.h or MMDevice.h.) The device code base changed recently, hence the problem you had loading the latest Hamamatsu adapter. If your OpenSPIM installation updated, but you're still using source code from before then, any adapters you build will not be loaded by Micro-Manager. When did you fetch the source code from github? Recently, as a part of trying to get the development environment working? If not, have you done a 'git pull' in /src/micromanager to update the source code recently?


Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Dear Johannes and Peter,

Thank you vey much for the information. Can I please find out the part number for the mirror grid used in the light sheet calibration as this information is not included in http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration.

Best Regards,
John

To enhance on that comment until the time when Dr Jan chimes in, this is
how we measure the light-sheet thickness: we use the same mirror as for
the light-sheet calibration described here:

        http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration

(unfortunately, the description of the last steps of that page have not
yet been completed.)

In the last steps, what we do is to use an improvised transmission light
(we really use a reading light and shine that through the sample chamber)
to get the mirror into focus both with the transmission light and the
light-sheet by having the mirror (also called grid on the page because it
is a gridded mirror) at 45 degrees such that the light-sheet is reflected
directly into the camera.

At that stage, the light-sheet thickness can be measured exactly by
calibrating the pixel spacing with the known grid spacing and the simply
counting the number of pixels of the width (because the light-sheet is now
directed directly into the camera, parallel to the detection axis).

The height of the light-sheet is configurable to a certain extent: you can
make it narrower or larger by adjusting the iris in the last part of the
illumination axis. Of course, you still want it to be relatively uniform
over the height; we found it reasonable uniform in the field of view we
use (and we made it a little larger than that). Although I have to admit
that we never came around to *really* quantify this.

Ciao,
Johannes

This might be of interest for some SPIM applications. One could maybe integrate light sheet illumination into an Olympus frame and then control it with the OpenSPIM software?

its the one listed in the link to Edmunds Optics on that webpage, the direct link is http://www.edmundoptics.com/testing-targets/test-targets/resolution-test-targets/opal-glass-ronchi-ruling-slides/2838

It looks like Edmunds Website is having problems at the moment, so you could also call them to order, its part# 58607, MULTI-GRID STANDARD MICROMETER

To make it fit, we scored with a diamond pencil as shown in the picture. You could also other similar micrometer products sold by Thorlabs etc.

Hello,

Is there a way to ask more questions, in addition to those already on the
FAQ?  I'm beginning an Open SPIM build and would like clarification on some
of the parts.  For instance, in the sample preparation section, where can
one find and purchase the capillaries and plungers which are used to make
the agarose columns?  I am sure I will have other questions as the build
goes on.

Thanks,

Very good!

Please note that I replaced the 'openspim at mpi-cbg.de' with
'openspim at openspim.org' (the correct mailing list address) now; the latter
was also affected but is fixed now.

I've tested Johannes' fix on a Windows XP VM and it (with a small tweak) it works just fine over here. Thankfully, tclsh is included in our msysGit package, so it should work on just about any version of Windows. Have you had a chance to test it on your Windows 7 machine? (The more people with different hardware and software configurations we have testing these things, the more support we'll be able to offer!)

Please notice that I made a small commit on top of yours to fix some backslash escaping, so please be sure to pull before merging it.


Thanks!

Hi Luke,

I pushed a new topic branch (as threatened) with the first steps to get us
up-to-date with upstream Micro-Manager.

If I did not forget, I marked all problematic commits with "TODODODO!" in
the commit subject. Note that I removed four commits marked "TODOs", or
"to-undo".

The most problematic remaining issue is most likely:

	https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/4ea03944dd485

According to

	http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Building_MM_on_Windows

it should still build with Visual Studio 2010 Express, though.

I have a vague memory that one of my colleagues found a supplier of
similar materials in the US. If you need a European supplier, I think
Braun is to contact.

Hey everyone!

Julie Last and I did some extensive imaging today, and I think the results speak quite well of our work. Attached to this email are three maximum-projections in PNG format of stacks we acquired today; two are from a 6-view acquisition while the third (the one including the head of the embryo) was its own stack. After projecting I tweaked the brightness and contrast to get a good image.


What do you think?

Hi Luke,

it seems that we might have been a bit too secretive about our efforts to
use VS 2010. Maybe it is time to get in touch with Mark?

As I have mentioned on this list recently, I'm working on migrating
Micro-Manager to VS2010, and will hopefully be able to make the new
project files available soon.

That is some nice contrast! How many slices did you max-project?

Also, as I told Julie on her way out: we absolutely have to use
off-frequency beads. Our signal is too delicate to be overlaid by beads
having a field day.

This might need some changes on the Wiki to make it *very clear* that you
should *never* use beads that are excited by exactly the wavelength of the
laser.

The page people will read first (if they read any documentation at all,
that is), is certainly http://openspim.org/Operation (and it does not
mention the wavelength issue at all). There *is* a section hidden in
http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation about that, but
it is unlikely that this page is what people read *before* they image
their samples and see super-bright beads triggering the full-moon effect.

It would be nice, for example, if maybe people from Dresden could
expand that section, move it to its own page, document there which
particular beads worked for them (to give a good idea what beads might
work for others, too), and then link to that page from all the appropriate
places.

Hmm?

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Pavel & Johannes (and everyone),

The thick lines are flares from tremendously overbright beads.We used 20um beads for this sample, as we were having trouble getting a clean solution of .2um beads. Too much light from the 20um beads gave our Orca's detector a hard time.

It varies between the images, I believe between 100 and 200 slices.

I agree. Before we finished imaging, Julie decided to work with the red beads on Monday; next Thursday we should be able to put together some samples with weaker beads.

I should point out that these are 20um beads causing the flares. It's possible that sub-resolution beads (even those specifically excited by our laser) won't have the same dramatic effect as these. In other words '*never*' might be a bit overzealous; I'm sure there are times when operators would like a very strong bead signal.

I agree, of course. It's naive to hope people would read our suggestions for sample prep; I imagine they have a protocol they're already familiar with.

We can probably add a note to the sample prep section on the Operation page, with a link to a page about which beads we've found work well.

Thanks,
Luke

Given that Dresden had substantial problems even with sub-resolution
beads, I would actually wager a bet that "never" is the correct adjective
here: I highly doubt that any non-toxic amounts of fluorophores translated
from reporter genes would come even close to the amount of fluorophores
present even in the tiniest sub-resolution beads made by humans.

In any case, the idea of OpenSPIM is to make things easier by sharing
knowledge, right? So even if I'd lose my bet, it would be the appropriate
thing to share the insight that non-off-color beads *were* too bright in
our case.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello,

My name is Luke Stuyvenberg; I'm a programmer for the OpenSPIM project (http://www.openspim.org and the openspim at openspim.org mailing list).

On 06/13/13, Mark Tsuchida  wrote:

We've actually been working on this task separately as well, and I was thinking some of our work might be of use to you. You can see the current state of our code at http://github.com/openspim/micromanager -- I believe the project files are based off of Micro-Manager 1.4.13 or so (from the source code available roughly 2 months ago). I should note that our directory structure is somewhat different from vanilla Micro-Manager; for instance, we copy our device adapters to Fiji.app/mm/$(Platform) rather than the executable directory; additionally, because of our basis in Fiji, some other paths may not be entirely accurate.


At present, I've successfully built MMCore, MMCoreJ_wrap, and mmstudio (using the ant build file) from VS2010 Express (and also using msbuild from the command line), as well as several of the device adapters needed for our project -- CoherentCube and PicardStage specifically; also SerialManager and DemoCamera for good measure. (I've also built many of the other device adapters, but the aforementioned ones are most commonly built, being central to our project.) If you'd like to incorporate any of our work, or if we can be of any other assistance in this task, please don't hesitate to let us know!


Sincerely,
Luke Stuyvenberg


P.S. I have a few plans to work on VS2012 support as time arises; if in the future that work may also be helpful, feel free to write myself and our mailing list.

Hi Mark,

(Whoops; we lost the mailing list.)

I had expected it might be the case that a merge wouldn't be viable, but thanks for the heads-up just the same. We were actually planning to rebase soon to pick up the changes for x64; given how close you seem to be to finishing the VS2010 project files, I think we'll hold off on that until you've finished. I'll also be looking forward to the changes they bring; managing the output paths has been something of an issue for us in the past.


Thanks,
Luke

I am also moving common settings to property sheets, though, so setting up things like different copy destination paths should become easier.

I will expand the section 

http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#What_beads_to_use.3F

on the bead selection. It is a complex problem with three variables, the strength of your signal, the laser power and the properties of your emission filter (band-pass versus long-pass). I recommend to get several wavelengths of beads and experiment with your particular conditions. I can provide some guidelines for His-YFP.

That the lines come from beads came as a surprise to me. This is most likely caused by the fact that they are too large, i.e. not sub resolution. Bright beads can be a little disturbing but I have never seen anything like that.

All the best

Hi Luke,

I re-Cc:ed the list because I feel it to be inappropriate to keep this

Right. That's what I meant by: our work was basically wasting time because
we cannot continue to use those changes.

Unless you disagree, let's focus more on early collaboration on things
that are not specific to OpenSPIM.

I agree. The easier it is to build it all, the better. Remember: I want
Jenkins to build this thing eventually.

I certainly didn't mean to withhold information; in this case, it may of 
been better to include the full text of my message. I've done so at the 
bottom of this email.

As I said in my email to Mark, I intend to wait until they're done 
switching the SVN head.

Not many of them, no. But as I said in the original (complete) text of 
my email to you, good things _did_ come out of it -- for example, the 
new build script, which I don't believe could have been developed with 
the '08 build files (2010 was when msbuild, using an XML-based build 
file, was introduced; it is this executable that the new build script 
relies on.

I'm not entirely familiar with Jenkins' capabilities -- would it be able 
to run our build scripts as they sit? Or should I begin preparing i.e. 
an overall ant or msbuild build file?

We lost the mailing lists on this reply; I've let Mark know, but on the off chance he deliberately left them out of the communication, I haven't re-included micro-manager's (only our own).

Like I said. merge -s 'ours'. But I have to disagree with what you said in IRC -- our work wasn't wasted; though our project files will likely be replaced by those put out by Mark, things like the new build script (which couldn't have been developed with '08) are still valuable, an in fact will probably require minimal changes to work with the new project files.


Either way, though, our rebase is going to be painful. Personally, I'd like to suggest we just accept Micro-Manager's changes to all vcxproj and sln files (or not apply any of our own, as the case may be), then fix our build when the dust settles. It isn't ideal, but at least this way we have a well-defined conflict resolution for those files...


While we're on the topic of the build system, I wanted to run an idea past you -- that is, adding VS projects for the Micro-Manager plugins and acquisition engine. For people less inclined to build from the command line, it may be helpful to create these projects and add them to our working solution (most likely after the VS2010 update and our rebase). The basic idea is much like that of Micro-Manager; I will probably just have the project use NMake to call the ant build files of the plugins and acquisition engine. (Especially considering since we say 'press F7 to build it all', it would make sense to do this.)


Let me know what you think.

Jenkins can run everything you write as a script. Hence, since you worked
so hard on build.sh (which I appreciate very, very much), I think we are
very close to getting there.

There are only a few tricky parts, such as: how does the Jenkins job get
the 3rdpartypublic (and maybe even the 3rdparty) repository? It is
relatively easy to solve, though.

And since we have a Windows node to Jenkins (and can tell Jenkins to run a
particular job *only* on a particular node), we are sooo close
*puts-his-fingers-really-close-and-squints-his-eyes*.

Hi Johannes and Luke,

sorry for my mutism; I was mostly on the roads the last week. 
I have tested the tailored openspim.sh script and it indeed leads to many more things happening: cloning of the repositories and initiating the build. In principle it is all good. 
What does not seem to work: creating the shortcut to the Dev env on the network
It always install in ~/Git/ not where one specifies, but this could be due to me executing the script by hand, not putting it in  etc/profile.d/

Once you have a new dev-env installer, I'd be happy to beta-test it for you on Windows7.

With my best regards,

Alexis

Thankfully, tclsh is included in our msysGit package, so it should work on just about any version of Windows. Have you had a chance to test it on your Windows 7 machine? (The more people with different hardware and software configurations we have testing these things, the more support we'll be able to offer!)

That's good news!

Sorry, I do not quite understand: do you try to install the dev env
anywhere else than something like C:\openspim-dev-env\ ? Or do you try to
install it to something like \\my-other-machine\openspim-dev-env\ ? The
latter is not something I would expect to work.

Or is your desktop on a network drive that is not mapped to a drive
letter?

Again, I do not understand... what is installed in ~/Git/? The
micro-manager source? (That is what the script -- if you are referring to
openspim.sh, that is -- is supposed to check out, and it probably relies
on the current working directory being / -- i.e. the root directory of the
development environment)

I would really love to come up with a new dev-env installer for you to
test, but I do not understand the problems, so I cannot attempt a solution
:-(

Thanks for your help!
Johannes

No. I install it either in C:\openspim-dev-env\  or in C:\Users\User\Desktop\openspim-dev-env\

Everything is local.

Yes the script checks out 'micromanager'. 
I have found the origin of the problem:  I had not put the openspim.sh in /etc/profile.d  and executed the script. 
Now I have put it there and then launched git-bash.sh (which I assumed was the master script invoked by the executable archive). 
It is now installing everything it needs in src/, install the shortcuts  and build everything without any problems.
FULL success. thanks!
  
On another note, my implementation of the shutter APIs into the Cobolt are functional. I have recompiled it with the proper MM base code and it loads and runs seamlessly in OpenSPIM. 
So in principle our setup is now 100% functional under windows 7 with 'non native' OpenSPIM hardware. :-)

With my best regards,

Alexis

Hi everyone,

20 um beads are way too big for this purpose and result in the super-bright balls which oversaturate the CCD. We have good experience with the 0.5 um Estaphor "green" beads (well vortexed, try w/o sample first!). I added a page "beads" to the wiki and linked it to the sample preparation section:

http://openspim.org/Sample_Preparation

So far you find some information about the beads I used in Pavel's and Jan's lab. I suggest to move bead-relevant stuff on this one page, rather than spreading it to individual pages.

cheers,
Michael

Yes, /etc/profile is executed by the shell when called with --login, and
msysGit's /etc/profile launches all the scripts in /etc/profile.d/.

That's cool! If you don't mind, would you add a photo of your setup to

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the cylindrical lens
Message-ID: <OFCC02171B.2CAA79A9-ONC1257B98.005A4B5D-C1257B98.005A4B64@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi dear All,

I just have a problem:
Since more than 4 weeks ago I ordered the thorlabs parts for the OpenSPIM, the only one is
missing is the cylindrical lens (it was supposed to arrive like two weeks ago). I just
contact them and the problem is that they don't have in stock the ACY254-050-A; they?
would need to manufacture it and that would take a little long time.

So they propose to?use the?ACY254-075-A, the only difference of this lens is that the focal length is 75 mm
instead of 50 mm. I can see from the Open SPIM design that maybe would be possible to use this lens
if it is moved 25 mm closer to the first two achromatic doublets used to expand the beam in comparison
to the position of the 50 mm focal length lens. I am not an optics expert but maybe it can work.

Anothe solution I found out is to use the??LJ1695RM-A, a cylindrical plano-convex lens from Thorlabs with focal length 50 mm,
AR coating 400-750 nm?but with the disadvantage that?it is not Achromatic,?http://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LJ1695RM-A. So if I will use only monochromatic illumination sources maybe is not a big deal to use this lens.

So, what do you think is the best solution? I would really appreciate if someone can give me her/his advice.

Kind regards.

Dear Dr. Jan

My is John from Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore. Our lab is in the process of setting up the Open SPIM. Can I please find out the height and thickness of the light sheet created by the Open SPIM setup?

It will also be very helpful if images of both the height and thickness of the light sheet can be posted on the Open SPIM web site. Those images will serve as useful reference as we setup the Open SPIM in the lab.

Best Regards,
John

Hello Luke,
thanks a bunch for the precise and helpful message. 
I only had the opportunity to do  some tests today and it revealed quite frustrating:  

> If you fully update your OpenSPIM installation (Help -> Update Fiji), when you launch Micro-Manager it should register as 'v1.4.x dev' (I believe the code was between 1.4.13 and 1.4.14).

First, I had (stupidly) never thought about upgrading the OpenSPIM's Fiji. Indeed, now the MM version is "1.4.x dev" 	 

> I just tested now (Windows XP, freshly up-to-date OpenSPIM-20130131.zip, with an Orca R^2), and the software can load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll file included in the latest MM nightly build

Indeed it can now load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll
Unfortunately, it still can not communicate properly with the Camera (OrcaFlash4). The errors messages I get are:
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Error code 40 (28 hex)
Device HamamatsuHam_DCAM. Error in device HamamatsuHam_DCAM: Native Module failed to load

What is really surprising is that the same device Adapter works perfectly (camera is operated and live stream works) when run into a 'standalone' MicroManager (tested: latest nightly build, v1.4.13 and v1.4.14). Therefore it seems that the issue resides into the MM version embedded into OpenSPIM (and/or that I am running Windows 7).

> I can't make any certain statements about support for Windows 7, unfortunately, since our goal at present is to maximize support for Windows XP first.

Trying to downgrade to windows XP is  something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 

> Regarding the development environment, I'm actively working on bringing it up-to-date, and your assistance in this would be invaluable -- I was hoping you might test something for me: Please try downloading https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe and installing it. This is a newer version of the installer, and hopefully should at least finish putting everything into place.

Thanks for this. I am certainly willing/wanting to serve as your guinea-pig for this. Idiot-testing  is always useful. 

Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point. 

I am motivated to get this to work, so please involve me. 

With my best regards,

Alexis

Dear John,

The lightsheet with the stated optics is around 7-10 um. We are working on a lightsheet thickness
calculator that we will put on the wiki as soon as it it finished.

Thank you for your understanding in advance.

Hi Pete,

I thought maybe you need yet another distraction. So I added the link to
the MSIM project to our Links:

	http://openspim.org/Links#Other_Open_Access_projects

In the paper
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462167/?report=reader#!po=65.9091
they have a link to the supplemental material
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462167/bin/NIHMS397910-supplement-1.pdf
whose figure 3 shows their setup.

I do not know what you are up to these days, but maybe you want to look at
that and figure out whether there is an easy way to modify the OpenSPIM
1.0 hardware to support that mode?

Ciao,
Johannes

To enhance on that comment until the time when Dr Jan chimes in, this is
how we measure the light-sheet thickness: we use the same mirror as for
the light-sheet calibration described here:

	http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration

(unfortunately, the description of the last steps of that page have not
yet been completed.)

In the last steps, what we do is to use an improvised transmission light
(we really use a reading light and shine that through the sample chamber)
to get the mirror into focus both with the transmission light and the
light-sheet by having the mirror (also called grid on the page because it
is a gridded mirror) at 45 degrees such that the light-sheet is reflected
directly into the camera.

At that stage, the light-sheet thickness can be measured exactly by
calibrating the pixel spacing with the known grid spacing and the simply
counting the number of pixels of the width (because the light-sheet is now
directed directly into the camera, parallel to the detection axis).

The height of the light-sheet is configurable to a certain extent: you can
make it narrower or larger by adjusting the iris in the last part of the
illumination axis. Of course, you still want it to be relatively uniform
over the height; we found it reasonable uniform in the field of view we
use (and we made it a little larger than that). Although I have to admit
that we never came around to *really* quantify this.

Ciao,
Johannes

This might be the "new" error message instead of the old "core property is
read-only" red herring. In our FAQ, we describe the real reason:

http://openspim.org/FAQ#I_get_the_error_that_a_core_property_is_read-only.3F

It is simply a mismatch between the memory management of the device
adapter layer and the Java memory management: Fiji tries to grab as much
memory as possible, not leaving enough for the Hamamatsu driver. So: just
go to Edit>Options>Memory & Threads and limit the RAM to leave enough
space for the low-level driver.

Yep, this is the tell-tale for the memory problem described above.
Unfortunately, we did not get the Hamamatsu people to provide a sensible
error message, and the driver is closed source, so we really cannot do
anything about it.

Fair enough. You'll probably not be the only person to have that problem,
so I'd appreciate you helping us to get the software working on Windows 7,
too.

Thank you so much! We really need this to work for all people willing to
contribute, and solving the obstacles you face will help that.

I take it you already have Visual Express Studio installed? If so, which
one? And do you you see the file

	C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/Common7/IDE/VCExpress.exe

or similar?

Johannes

I think the difference, as Johannes mentioned, is Fiji's approach to memory usage. OpenSPIM uses the Fiji loader, which is generally greedy about memory, where (if I recall correctly) plain ImageJ (which the standalone MicroManager software runs off of) is more conservative. Specifying a sensible memory limit in Fiji should resolve the issue -- though oddly, I still get it the first time I start OpenSPIM after a reboot. Please let me know if you encounter the same issue.

(I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 



I agree completely; it would be excellent to get this software running on Windows 7 -- moreover, I aim to support x64. Now that Micro-Manager has released a 64-bit version, this is looking promising, though I have the suspicion it will entail another rebase.


> Basically, it seems that the 7z archive extracts Git-related files, then I am presented with a command prompt inviting me to install Visual Express Studio (see screenshot). Nothing beyond this point. 



Yes, this is the error the startup script provides when it doesn't find Visual C++ Express. Unfortunately, the script's current detection is limited to checking 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe' for existence -- meaning it expects an entirely normal hard drive setup and default VC Express installation. I hope to have an updated version of the script (and, with luck, perhaps another new installer) available in a few hours which will be considerably more flexible in its detection (hopefully, it will find and use VC Express 2008/2010 wherever it is installed, but in the worst case, you can change the aforementioned location by editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh -- right at the top we tell it where to look).


Thank you for your help!

Hey Alexis,

I've uploaded the new installer to http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130604.exe -- please give it a try after installing Visual C++ Express 2010. (I believe this is going to become the requirement for the OpenSPIM project -- the '08 project files are quickly falling into disrepair, both ours and those included with Micro-Manager.)


Thanks again!
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Luke,

> 
> I think the difference, as Johannes mentioned, is Fiji's approach to memory usage. OpenSPIM uses the Fiji loader, which is generally greedy about memory, where (if I recall correctly) plain ImageJ (which the standalone MicroManager software runs off of) is more conservative. Specifying a sensible memory limit in Fiji should resolve the issue -- though oddly, I still get it the first time I start OpenSPIM after a reboot. Please let me know if you encounter the same issue.

Indeed, limiting the amount of RAM solved the issue. I am quite happy to see that everything is now running. So in principle, Windows7 seems to be supported. 
However, I realised that our laser (Cobolt) does not appear into the list of available  Shutter. Any idea of what could go wrong? I can turn it  ON/OFF using the Device/Properties editor of MM.

Now let's try to do real stuff with this device :-)


>> Trying to downgrade to windows XP is something I have tried at the very beginning, but it seems the laptop we use is too modern for XP and after hours of attempts, I dropped that option. (I might add that in the medium-long term only supporting XP may really impair the 'Open' nature of OpenSPIM). 
> 
> I agree completely; it would be excellent to get this software running on Windows 7 -- moreover, I aim to support x64. Now that Micro-Manager has released a 64-bit version, this is looking promising, though I have the suspicion it will entail another rebase.

I only used 32bits versions so far. I'll test a 64bits versions when available.

> Yes, this is the error the startup script provides when it doesn't find Visual C++ Express. Unfortunately, the script's current detection is limited to checking 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe' for existence -- meaning it expects an entirely normal hard drive setup and default VC Express installation. I hope to have an updated version of the script (and, with luck, perhaps another new installer) available in a few hours which will be considerably more flexible in its detection (hopefully, it will find and use VC Express 2008/2010 wherever it is installed, but in the worst case, you can change the aforementioned location by editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh -- right at the top we tell it where to look).

I do have Visual C++ Express installed (2010). It resides on C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe

Thanks for the latest installer. But it hangs at the same points, after unzipping, the same command prompt. If I understood correctly, this self-executing archive should install a Git environment, and perform a clone of the OpenSPIM repository. In my case, after unzipping nothing happen, no Git active, no cloning,  only the ~19Mb of the archive are installed (see screenshot). Am I missing something?

Thanks for the tip on how to hack the /src/micromanager/openspim.sh, I will give it a shot from the source code I have 'manually' fetched from  Git.

best,

Hi Alexis,

I just looked into this, and it seems the developers of the Cobolt device adapter didn't make the device a shutter -- as a result, it won't appear in the shutter list. I don't want to alter this myself just yet, for fear of stepping on the author's toes -- see http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Cobolt for details.
Unfortunately, this will present problems with the OpenSPIM software, which expects a shutter device and might refuse to function without one. (At the very least, it should give you a warning.)
You might try asking the Micro-Manager mailing list, or Karl Bellve (the DAL's author) in particular, if there are plans to implement this behavior. Or, if you're feeling ambitious, once we have your development environment working, you may wish to make the changes yourself and contribute them to Micro-Manager.


> I only used 32bits versions so far. I'll test a 64bits versions when available.
I appreciate the volunteering! I'm hoping to have the rebase done before the month is over; I'll try to keep the mailing list informed.


> I do have Visual C++ Express installed (2010). It resides on C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\VCExpress.exe
Yes, the old installer wouldn't have checked for (x86), because it's not expecting to be run on a 64-bit system; it probably wouldn't have found the IDE. The new installer was supposed to fix this, but...


> Thanks for the latest installer. But it hangs at the same points, after unzipping, the same command prompt. If I understood correctly, this self-executing archive should install a Git environment, and perform a clone of the OpenSPIM repository. In my case, after unzipping nothing happen, no Git active, no cloning, only the ~19Mb of the archive are installed (see screenshot). Am I missing something?
When it hangs, do you mean it gives you the missing VC Express error? Or does it actually, physically stop doing anything?
In the former case, it means there's a problem with detecting VC Express. Using regedit, please check the following registry keys:
- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VCExpress.DTE\CurVer (the default value should have something like "VCExpress.DTE.10.0")
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VCExpress\10.0\InstallDir (it should match the path you gave me above)
These two keys are used to piece together the path to VC Express. If either is missing or incorrect, the script won't continue and will give you the message from earlier. Please let me know if there are any problems with these registry settings; I'm trying to make the startup script as general as possible, so knowing, for example, that not everyone may have a VCExpress.DTE entry is very helpful.


> Thanks for the tip on how to hack the /src/micromanager/openspim.sh, I will give it a shot from the source code I have 'manually' fetched from Git.


This still should be possible after the latest update: line 27 of openspim.sh should set the VCEXPRESS path. If you replace everything between the double-quotes with, for example, "C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\VCExpress.exe", it should work.


Thanks again,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Alexis,

I've once again updated the development environment installer, with what I hope will be a more reliable detection of VC Express. If the hang-up in the installer you mentioned is because it can't find VC Express, and editing /src/micromanager/openspim.sh doesn't resolve the problem, please:


- Delete C:\openspim-dev-env (or choose to install to a different directory)
- Delete C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\bin\vcexpress.sh (this may contain incorrect information)
- Download http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130605.exe (and install it)


Thanks, and let me know if you encounter any problems!
Luke Stuyvenberg

I do not mind altering the code myself. I have actually already  fixed and recompiled the code of this device adapter to squash a nasty line ending bug that was impeding proper commands to be sent on Windows. The bug had been here for ages but apparently that device adapter is not heavily used on Windows and I was the first one to notice it. Karl and I have committed the changes to MM code base.
  
I have been already  in contact with Karl so I can liaise with him to see if he objects to me adding the shutter feature.    

The 64'000$ question: how do I make a device a shutter? Can you point me to the appropriate documentation or code example? Although I have only limited C coding experience, the Cobolt device adapter code is definitively something in my league.

With my best regards,

Alexis

Hi Johannes,

Stephan Preibisch and myself will present a workshop on SPIMage processing at the conference. I talked about OpenSPIM at this meeting last year. It will be implicitly mentioned during the tutorials.

In other words this conference, which I started in Dresden - remember?, is covered.

All the best

PAvel

Here is the sequence of event: 
	- I double click the OpenSPIM-dev-env-XXXX.exe 
	- I pick the folder where to install
	- The 7z unarchiver unpacks the ~200Mb of files. (see screenshot for the content of the folder where things are extracted) 
	- The Command prompt requesting for VCExpress installation appears (other screenshot).
	- I close the terminal window. Nothing else happens.

 I indeed have the correct path in this entry.

Nothing at that location; however, I found it at:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\VCExpress.DTE\CurVer  and indeed contains "VCExpress.DTE.10.0"

With my best regards,

Alexis

I *think* all you have to do is extend the CShutterBase class:
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/DeviceAdapters/DemoCamera/DemoCamera.h#L695

(instead of CGenericBase:
https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/DeviceAdapters/Cobolt/Cobolt.h#L30)

Ciao,

Ah, so it is not a "hang" but more like: it does not do anything else than
wait for your user input.

>From your second screenshot, it looks as if the error is:

	bash: reg: command not found

And the culprit is of course:

	https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/blob/openspim/openspim.sh#L12

Seems that the "reg" tool is not as universally present as we originally
thought!

So can you please do the following:

- overwrite the file openspim.sh in your OpenSPIM-Dev-Env's etc/profile.d/
  subdirectory with this:

	https://raw.github.com/openspim/micromanager/for-alexis/openspim.sh

- start the "git-bash" Batch file in your OpenSPIM-Dev-Env

It should now do many, many more things than just complain about the
absence of Visual C++...

Once you report that it is working, I will make this part of the 'master'
branch and make a new dev-env installer.

Thanks!
Dscho

I suspect you'll also have to implement some specific member functions -- DemoCamera is a reasonable source, though I'd suggest using CoherentCube's DeviceAdapter for reference -- it doesn't contain code for a camera, and is more relevant to laser controllers. A quick overview of what I think will need changing:
- Cobolt.h line 30: change CGenericBase<Cobolt> to CShutterBase<Cobolt>
- Cobolt.h: add shutter API calls (see CoherentCube.h lines 153 - 156)
- Cobolt.cpp: Implement the shutter API functions -- probably, they will just call LaserOnOff with the right value.

Oops! Sorry; I don't yet have a Win7 machine/VM to test on, so I wasn't aware of this. tclsh is included in our dev env package, so I suppose we'd best switch to that. Thanks Johannes for the substitute.


Please let us know how the tests go!

Hi Luke,

I have used CoherentCube's as a template and modified the Cobolt code to implement the Shutter API. 
It compiles seamlessly. 
However, OpenSPIM now complains about this new device adapter: "Version Mismatch" (and list it as  "unavailable").

I assume that I use the wrong code base; but I must confess I am now totally lost. Given that my version of OpenSPIM utilises MM v1.4.xx Dev, which MM source code version should I use? 

Alexis

Is there a chance that you fork https://github.com/openspim/micromanager
and push your changes there? That would make it a bit easier to analyze
the situation on my side...

Hi Alexis,

The error message seems to confirm your assumption; it suggests that one of the files Cobolt depends on is out-of-date. (I suspect this file is most likely /src/micromanager/MMDevice/DeviceBase.h or MMDevice.h.) The device code base changed recently, hence the problem you had loading the latest Hamamatsu adapter. If your OpenSPIM installation updated, but you're still using source code from before then, any adapters you build will not be loaded by Micro-Manager. When did you fetch the source code from github? Recently, as a part of trying to get the development environment working? If not, have you done a 'git pull' in /src/micromanager to update the source code recently?


Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Dear Johannes and Peter,

Thank you vey much for the information. Can I please find out the part number for the mirror grid used in the light sheet calibration as this information is not included in http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration.

Best Regards,
John

To enhance on that comment until the time when Dr Jan chimes in, this is
how we measure the light-sheet thickness: we use the same mirror as for
the light-sheet calibration described here:

        http://openspim.org/Light-sheet_Calibration

(unfortunately, the description of the last steps of that page have not
yet been completed.)

In the last steps, what we do is to use an improvised transmission light
(we really use a reading light and shine that through the sample chamber)
to get the mirror into focus both with the transmission light and the
light-sheet by having the mirror (also called grid on the page because it
is a gridded mirror) at 45 degrees such that the light-sheet is reflected
directly into the camera.

At that stage, the light-sheet thickness can be measured exactly by
calibrating the pixel spacing with the known grid spacing and the simply
counting the number of pixels of the width (because the light-sheet is now
directed directly into the camera, parallel to the detection axis).

The height of the light-sheet is configurable to a certain extent: you can
make it narrower or larger by adjusting the iris in the last part of the
illumination axis. Of course, you still want it to be relatively uniform
over the height; we found it reasonable uniform in the field of view we
use (and we made it a little larger than that). Although I have to admit
that we never came around to *really* quantify this.

Ciao,
Johannes

This might be of interest for some SPIM applications. One could maybe integrate light sheet illumination into an Olympus frame and then control it with the OpenSPIM software?

its the one listed in the link to Edmunds Optics on that webpage, the direct link is http://www.edmundoptics.com/testing-targets/test-targets/resolution-test-targets/opal-glass-ronchi-ruling-slides/2838

It looks like Edmunds Website is having problems at the moment, so you could also call them to order, its part# 58607, MULTI-GRID STANDARD MICROMETER

To make it fit, we scored with a diamond pencil as shown in the picture. You could also other similar micrometer products sold by Thorlabs etc.

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8YsEq8LsD7wp31YY+WU931ptn8P2jJB3jFoBy1TvrnpsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is there a way to ask more questions, in addition to those already on the
FAQ?  I'm beginning an Open SPIM build and would like clarification on some
of the parts.  For instance, in the sample preparation section, where can
one find and purchase the capillaries and plungers which are used to make
the agarose columns?  I am sure I will have other questions as the build
goes on.

Thanks,
Aurelia

Very good!

Please note that I replaced the 'openspim at mpi-cbg.de' with
'openspim at openspim.org' (the correct mailing list address) now; the latter
was also affected but is fixed now.

Ciao,

I've tested Johannes' fix on a Windows XP VM and it (with a small tweak) it works just fine over here. Thankfully, tclsh is included in our msysGit package, so it should work on just about any version of Windows. Have you had a chance to test it on your Windows 7 machine? (The more people with different hardware and software configurations we have testing these things, the more support we'll be able to offer!)

Please notice that I made a small commit on top of yours to fix some backslash escaping, so please be sure to pull before merging it.

Hi Luke,

I pushed a new topic branch (as threatened) with the first steps to get us
up-to-date with upstream Micro-Manager.

If I did not forget, I marked all problematic commits with "TODODODO!" in
the commit subject. Note that I removed four commits marked "TODOs", or
"to-undo".

The most problematic remaining issue is most likely:

	https://github.com/openspim/micromanager/commit/4ea03944dd485

According to

	http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Building_MM_on_Windows

it should still build with Visual Studio 2010 Express, though.

I have a vague memory that one of my colleagues found a supplier of

Braun is to contact.

Hey everyone!

Julie Last and I did some extensive imaging today, and I think the results speak quite well of our work. Attached to this email are three maximum-projections in PNG format of stacks we acquired today; two are from a 6-view acquisition while the third (the one including the head of the embryo) was its own stack. After projecting I tweaked the brightness and contrast to get a good image.


What do you think?

it seems that we might have been a bit too secretive about our efforts to

That is some nice contrast! How many slices did you max-project?

Also, as I told Julie on her way out: we absolutely have to use
off-frequency beads. Our signal is too delicate to be overlaid by beads
having a field day.

This might need some changes on the Wiki to make it *very clear* that you
should *never* use beads that are excited by exactly the wavelength of the
laser.

The page people will read first (if they read any documentation at all,
that is), is certainly http://openspim.org/Operation (and it does not
mention the wavelength issue at all). There *is* a section hidden in
http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation about that, but
it is unlikely that this page is what people read *before* they image
their samples and see super-bright beads triggering the full-moon effect.

It would be nice, for example, if maybe people from Dresden could
expand that section, move it to its own page, document there which
particular beads worked for them (to give a good idea what beads might
work for others, too), and then link to that page from all the appropriate
places.

Hmm?

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Pavel & Johannes (and everyone),

On 06/14/13, Pavel Tomancak wrote:

The thick lines are flares from tremendously overbright beads.We used 20um beads for this sample, as we were having trouble getting a clean solution of .2um beads. Too much light from the 20um beads gave our Orca's detector a hard time.


On 06/14/13, Johannes Schindelin wrote:

It varies between the images, I believe between 100 and 200 slices.

I agree. Before we finished imaging, Julie decided to work with the red beads on Monday; next Thursday we should be able to put together some samples with weaker beads.

I should point out that these are 20um beads causing the flares. It's possible that sub-resolution beads (even those specifically excited by our laser) won't have the same dramatic effect as these. In other words '*never*' might be a bit overzealous; I'm sure there are times when operators would like a very strong bead signal.

I agree, of course. It's naive to hope people would read our suggestions for sample prep; I imagine they have a protocol they're already familiar with.

We can probably add a note to the sample prep section on the Operation page, with a link to a page about which beads we've found work well.

Thanks,
Luke

Given that Dresden had substantial problems even with sub-resolution
beads, I would actually wager a bet that "never" is the correct adjective
here: I highly doubt that any non-toxic amounts of fluorophores translated
from reporter genes would come even close to the amount of fluorophores
present even in the tiniest sub-resolution beads made by humans.

In any case, the idea of OpenSPIM is to make things easier by sharing
knowledge, right? So even if I'd lose my bet, it would be the appropriate
thing to share the insight that non-off-color beads *were* too bright in
our case.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello,

My name is Luke Stuyvenberg; I'm a programmer for the OpenSPIM project (http://www.openspim.org and the openspim at openspim.org mailing list).

On 06/13/13, Mark Tsuchida  wrote:
> As I have mentioned on this list recently, I&#39;m working on migrating Micro-Manager to VS2010, and will hopefully be able to make the new project files available soon.


We've actually been working on this task separately as well, and I was thinking some of our work might be of use to you. You can see the current state of our code at http://github.com/openspim/micromanager -- I believe the project files are based off of Micro-Manager 1.4.13 or so (from the source code available roughly 2 months ago). I should note that our directory structure is somewhat different from vanilla Micro-Manager; for instance, we copy our device adapters to Fiji.app/mm/$(Platform) rather than the executable directory; additionally, because of our basis in Fiji, some other paths may not be entirely accurate.


At present, I've successfully built MMCore, MMCoreJ_wrap, and mmstudio (using the ant build file) from VS2010 Express (and also using msbuild from the command line), as well as several of the device adapters needed for our project -- CoherentCube and PicardStage specifically; also SerialManager and DemoCamera for good measure. (I've also built many of the other device adapters, but the aforementioned ones are most commonly built, being central to our project.) If you'd like to incorporate any of our work, or if we can be of any other assistance in this task, please don't hesitate to let us know!


Sincerely,
Luke Stuyvenberg


P.S. I have a few plans to work on VS2012 support as time arises; if in the future that work may also be helpful, feel free to write myself and our mailing list.

Hi Mark,

(Whoops; we lost the mailing list.)

I had expected it might be the case that a merge wouldn't be viable, but thanks for the heads-up just the same. We were actually planning to rebase soon to pick up the changes for x64; given how close you seem to be to finishing the VS2010 project files, I think we'll hold off on that until you've finished. I'll also be looking forward to the changes they bring; managing the output paths has been something of an issue for us in the past.


Thanks,
Luke

The Core and the device adaptors without external dependencies have not presented much of a problem, and most of the work has been getting the device adapters to build against external libraries. I have pretty much gotten everything working except for the most recently added device adapters (which I simply haven't gotten around to yet).

I am also moving common settings to property sheets, though, so setting up things like different copy destination paths should become easier.

I will expand the section 

http://openspim.org/Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#What_beads_to_use.3F

on the bead selection. It is a complex problem with three variables, the strength of your signal, the laser power and the properties of your emission filter (band-pass versus long-pass). I recommend to get several wavelengths of beads and experiment with your particular conditions. I can provide some guidelines for His-YFP.

That the lines come from beads came as a surprise to me. This is most likely caused by the fact that they are too large, i.e. not sub resolution. Bright beads can be a little disturbing but I have never seen anything like that.

All the best

PAvel

Hi Luke,

I re-Cc:ed the list because I feel it to be inappropriate to keep this
conversation a secret from our collaborators.

Not really, *iff* we wait until Mark switches their HEAD to 2010, and
*iff* you simply delete all of our changes to .vcxproj files.

Right. That's what I meant by: our work was basically wasting time because
we cannot continue to use those changes.

Unless you disagree, let's focus more on early collaboration on things
that are not specific to OpenSPIM.

I agree. The easier it is to build it all, the better. Remember: I want
Jenkins to build this thing eventually.

I certainly didn't mean to withhold information; in this case, it may of 
been better to include the full text of my message. I've done so at the 
bottom of this email.

As I said in my email to Mark, I intend to wait until they're done 
switching the SVN head.

Not many of them, no. But as I said in the original (complete) text of 
my email to you, good things _did_ come out of it -- for example, the 
new build script, which I don't believe could have been developed with 
the '08 build files (2010 was when msbuild, using an XML-based build 
file, was introduced; it is this executable that the new build script 
relies on.

I'm not entirely familiar with Jenkins' capabilities -- would it be able 
to run our build scripts as they sit? Or should I begin preparing i.e. 
an overall ant or msbuild build file?

We lost the mailing lists on this reply; I've let Mark know, but on the off chance he deliberately left them out of the communication, I haven't re-included micro-manager's (only our own).

Like I said. merge -s 'ours'. But I have to disagree with what you said in IRC -- our work wasn't wasted; though our project files will likely be replaced by those put out by Mark, things like the new build script (which couldn't have been developed with '08) are still valuable, an in fact will probably require minimal changes to work with the new project files.


Either way, though, our rebase is going to be painful. Personally, I'd like to suggest we just accept Micro-Manager's changes to all vcxproj and sln files (or not apply any of our own, as the case may be), then fix our build when the dust settles. It isn't ideal, but at least this way we have a well-defined conflict resolution for those files...


While we're on the topic of the build system, I wanted to run an idea past you -- that is, adding VS projects for the Micro-Manager plugins and acquisition engine. For people less inclined to build from the command line, it may be helpful to create these projects and add them to our working solution (most likely after the VS2010 update and our rebase). The basic idea is much like that of Micro-Manager; I will probably just have the project use NMake to call the ant build files of the plugins and acquisition engine. (Especially considering since we say 'press F7 to build it all', it would make sense to do this.)


Let me know what you think.

Jenkins can run everything you write as a script. Hence, since you worked
so hard on build.sh (which I appreciate very, very much), I think we are
very close to getting there.

There are only a few tricky parts, such as: how does the Jenkins job get
the 3rdpartypublic (and maybe even the 3rdparty) repository? It is
relatively easy to solve, though.

And since we have a Windows node to Jenkins (and can tell Jenkins to run a
particular job *only* on a particular node), we are sooo close
*puts-his-fingers-really-close-and-squints-his-eyes*.

Hi Johannes and Luke,

sorry for my mutism; I was mostly on the roads the last week. 
I have tested the tailored openspim.sh script and it indeed leads to many more things happening: cloning of the repositories and initiating the build. In principle it is all good. 
What does not seem to work: creating the shortcut to the Dev env on the network
It always install in ~/Git/ not where one specifies, but this could be due to me executing the script by hand, not putting it in  etc/profile.d/

Once you have a new dev-env installer, I'd be happy to beta-test it for you on Windows7.

With my best regards,

Alexis

That's good news!

Sorry, I do not quite understand: do you try to install the dev env
anywhere else than something like C:\openspim-dev-env\ ? Or do you try to
install it to something like \\my-other-machine\openspim-dev-env\ ? The
latter is not something I would expect to work.

Or is your desktop on a network drive that is not mapped to a drive
letter?

Again, I do not understand... what is installed in ~/Git/? The
micro-manager source? (That is what the script -- if you are referring to
openspim.sh, that is -- is supposed to check out, and it probably relies
on the current working directory being / -- i.e. the root directory of the
development environment)

I would really love to come up with a new dev-env installer for you to
test, but I do not understand the problems, so I cannot attempt a solution
:-(

Thanks for your help!
Johannes

No. I install it either in C:\openspim-dev-env\  or in C:\Users\User\Desktop\openspim-dev-env\

Everything is local.

Yes the script checks out 'micromanager'. 
I have found the origin of the problem:  I had not put the openspim.sh in /etc/profile.d  and executed the script. 
Now I have put it there and then launched git-bash.sh (which I assumed was the master script invoked by the executable archive). 
It is now installing everything it needs in src/, install the shortcuts  and build everything without any problems.
FULL success. thanks!
  
On another note, my implementation of the shutter APIs into the Cobolt are functional. I have recompiled it with the proper MM base code and it loads and runs seamlessly in OpenSPIM. 
So in principle our setup is now 100% functional under windows 7 with 'non native' OpenSPIM hardware. :-)

With my best regards,

Alexis

Hi everyone,

20 um beads are way too big for this purpose and result in the super-bright balls which oversaturate the CCD. We have good experience with the 0.5 um Estaphor "green" beads (well vortexed, try w/o sample first!). I added a page "beads" to the wiki and linked it to the sample preparation section:

http://openspim.org/Sample_Preparation

So far you find some information about the beads I used in Pavel's and Jan's lab. I suggest to move bead-relevant stuff on this one page, rather than spreading it to individual pages.

cheers,
Michael

Yes, /etc/profile is executed by the shell when called with --login, and
msysGit's /etc/profile launches all the scripts in /etc/profile.d/.

That's cool! If you don't mind, would you add a photo of your setup to

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the cylindrical lens
Message-ID: <OFCC02171B.2CAA79A9-ONC1257B98.005A4B5D-C1257B98.005A4B64@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi dear All,

I just have a problem:
Since more than 4 weeks ago I ordered the thorlabs parts for the OpenSPIM, the only one is
missing is the cylindrical lens (it was supposed to arrive like two weeks ago). I just
contact them and the problem is that they don't have in stock the ACY254-050-A; they 
would need to manufacture it and that would take a little long time.

So they propose to use the ACY254-075-A, the only difference of this lens is that the focal length is 75 mm
instead of 50 mm. I can see from the Open SPIM design that maybe would be possible to use this lens
if it is moved 25 mm closer to the first two achromatic doublets used to expand the beam in comparison
to the position of the 50 mm focal length lens. I am not an optics expert but maybe it can work.

Anothe solution I found out is to use the  LJ1695RM-A, a cylindrical plano-convex lens from Thorlabs with focal length 50 mm,
AR coating 400-750 nm but with the disadvantage that it is not Achromatic, http://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LJ1695RM-A. So if I will use only monochromatic illumination sources maybe is not a big deal to use this lens.

So, what do you think is the best solution? I would really appreciate if someone can give me her/his advice.

Kind regards.
