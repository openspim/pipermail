To anybody who was using Fiji with OpenSPIM update site and was 
experiencing java.lang.IllegalStateException errors lately (when 
starting fiji and at some other times): it's fixed now, but you need to 
remove some files manually, see below.

  COMMENT # 4 [2] ON BUG 1214 [1] FROM CURTIS RUEDEN

After consulting with Hongkee Moon, we discovered that the
Micro-Manager-dev
update site, used by the OpenSPIM update site, had many invalid/obsolete
duplicate libraries present in the plugins/Micro-Manager subfolder.

These duplicates interfered with the normal operations of ImageJ.

I have removed all the duplicates from the Micro-Manager-dev update
site, so
this problem should not bite others using OpenSPIM anymore -- at least
for now.

To repair your local installation, remove all
plugins/Micro-Manager/scijava-common-*.jar files from your installation.
Then
launch OpenSPIM and run the updater (which should now launch
successfully) to
update everything else.

And please feel free to reopen this issue if the problem recurs.

Message-ID: <op.yciiicchahhlbl@pc507-99ff.ibd>

Hi,

I am using an argon laser that only has a manual shutter, and so I'm  
having problems with photobleaching. Could anybody recommend a low-cost  
shutter that I could use to reduce bleaching in between stacks?

Hi Monika

I haven't looked into the details, but thought this kind of thing would be super low cost, and fun too:
http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Laser-Shutter/
With some thinking you might even be able to control it using the TTL (I believe 3V) from a serial LPT port if you have one.

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody has any experience, or knows of any studies, regarding the differences between low melting point agarose gels?  Is it a case of low melting point agarose is low melting point agarose and that's it, or are there subtleties between brands and composition, and/or handling that affect the results?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Hey everyone,


the solution Neil suggested works *really* well and is probably as low-cost as you can get. MicroManager is even able to use Arduinos as shutter, see?https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Control_laser_shutters_with_Arduino


cheers!

Monika,

I'd vote for the Arduino approach too-especially for the built in device adapter for micromanager.  A little bit of mucking about with the adapter would get you full control through the plugin.  I used this approach to integrate an AOTF.

Unless you know someone to write the device adapter for the picard shutter (they provided a dll)...

Thanks for all the advice! I guess I'll try the Arduino then, if it  
doesn't work I can still buy a proper shutter and maybe use Arduino for  
something else later.

Hi Monika,
We are looking for shutters here for an other application and found this 
one : http://marketplace.idexop.com/store/IdexCustom/PartDetails?pId=396
It's major advantage is that you don't need any controler as it is 
directly TTL driven. So with an Arduino board, or the serial control as 
shutter on Micromanager  it should work directly.
Best regards,
Fr?d?ric

Subject: [OpenSPIM] z settle time
Message-ID: <558AD332-47DE-4FAB-B203-370FD612786A@cores.utah.edu>

Since I have two laser lines on my SPIM, I use the Micro-manager multi-dimensional acquisition function rather than the SPIM acquisition window. One problem with this is no z-settle time button. To get around this, I always acquire a transmitted image before the GFP channel to allow for the sample to settle. The problem is that this doubles my file sizes. Is there a simple way to program a delay before acquisition to allow for sample settling after z movement?

thanks

Dear all,

I am currently recording light sheet data on a Z.1 from Zeiss and was wondering if anyone would know how open a series of time points or positions or both such that you can play them with the bigdataviewer plugin.


Thanks a lot for your answers!

Hi HongKee, I hope the code is treating you well.

Sorry for the delay; I've been pulled in a couple of different directions recently, but have been coming back to the plugin code a little more now.  For completeness, I've cc'd the openspim list, and for reference our last conversation was part of a thread called "Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF packages?" that I hijacked at the start of the year.

Thanks for the details on SPIMTestDrive section of the code.  It's great to now have the option to step through and figure things out.  One thing that I'm not sure about is the location of the code that builds the GUI form.  In other code I see the option to show the design of the form in Netbeans, but I don't see that here.  Is the GUI programmatically created without IDE assistance?  If so, how hard would it be to pull that into a form design type file in Netbeans?  It really speeds up my understanding of the code if I can quickly reference the buttons and sliders etc. in the exploration and debug stages.

You had previously asked about my direction in the plugin, and a large part of it would be to make the interface more user friendly and graphical.  My setup will be part of our core facility and I hope to have researchers here using the software once things are up and rolling.  If the GUI it is more programmatic, could you point me to that structure/code/... and maybe I could start from there.

My second direction would be to add the option of different hardware to the plugin.  Would it be possible to bring some sort of modularity to the GUI, that draws from the MM hardware settings and available core options?  Alternatively, might it be easier to add to the multidimensional acquisition panel in MM by including a rotation section?  You could then call that panel from the SPIM Acquisition plugin.

Sorry for the my somewhat fragmented questions/suggestions.  I'm sure it'll make more sense once I get into the details, and I appreciate any pointers you can offer as I get started.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi all, I hope the scopes are treating you well.

I have a general question for all.  I haven't yet taken any data (almost everything is in place and nearly ready to roll), but I'm curious to know about the axis of rotation when rotating the sample to different views.

Maybe I'm over thinking this, or the effects of being off axis are smaller than I imagine, but I'm really curious to know how people are experiencing and counteracting this part of the acquisition.  In a perfect world my theta would rotate around an axis parallel to the y axis and the sample would be placed on the rotation axis.  I could then translate the axis into the center of my camera and z-stack and rotate from there.  In reality, I'm guessing here as you know, you'd have an axis of rotation that's tilted to some degree, and the sample would likely be off center.  This would lead to samples moving in an arc when rotating, and xyz translation required to bring the region of interest back into view on each rotation.

Any experiences or thoughts in this direction are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi Neil

here are a few thoughts:

- The rotational axis can be determined very precisely by mounting a cylinder of fluorescent beads, switching on the laser and spinning the sample. You will see a ?snow storm? of beads. You keep on moving your sample in x and z until you see a line of beads that do not move. This is your rotational axis. Above this line you will see beads coming towards the lens, below away (or the other way around). You position this line of beads in your FOV?s center and call this stage position (0,y,0).

- Once you have determined the rotational axis you can find and center your sample in the FOV. (The sample will not necessarily be on the rational axis.) When your sample is in the FOV the stage position tells you how far away from the rational axis you are. Rotating now by an angle theta should go along with a translation along x and z that you can easily calculate with Sin(theta) and Cos(Theta) and the distance from the axis. The sample will now rotate around the FOV?s center. (I do not know how the openSPIM software handles this.)

- You can also build a little translational stage that allows you to reposition the sample with respect to the rotational axis (very important for OPT, useful for SPIM, see Bassi et al, Development 2015). This way you can always position the sample precisely on the rotational axis. 

- The rotational axis is never perfectly vertical (parallel to y). Generally this is not a big deal. If you want to do MV imaging you anyway need to register the data sets.

- Ideally you should have stages that are precise and reliable, i.e. they find the same position even after a few hours. Then you can image a bunch of beads from different directions at the beginning of your experiment, register the beads (Preibisch et al.) and you know once and forever how to register data from these directions. No need to embed ugly beads with your sample. Again, this assumes that you have a nice set of motors.

- It is important to understand that the registration of data is independent of the actual sample?s position. It does not matter if the FEP tube is bent, if the sample is at an angle or off-axis. The transformations necessary to register the data are solely determined by how (well) you have assembled the (hopefully precise) motors.

Hope this helps. 

Jan

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone is using a Stradus Versalase with OpenSPIM and if so i'm interested in knowing what properties of the laser are required and included in the micro-manager config group/preset.  So far i have created a Micro-Manager config file that contains all the required SPIM devices.

Thanks,

Hi Matt, 

We use a 488/561 Versalase with an ESio TTL controller to enhance
switching speed.  Our setup largely followed a design that was generously
provided by Johannes Girstmair in the Telford lab at University College
London, with a few modifications to fit our needs.  He provided me
extensive help that I can pass along if he has not done already.

Overall it works quite well.  If you use a TTL controller, you will want
to add the following to the Configuration Settings window in
Micro-Manager: 

Laser_[A/B/C/D]_LaserEmission
Laser_[color]_DigitalPeakPowerSetting
TTL_State (I rename this setting 'color' and name the TTL states that
result in the desired outputs 'green', 'red' and 'off'.  This lets me set
multi-channel images by assigning the 'color' variable in Multi-D
Acquisition)

Turn on DigitalModulation in the Device Property Browser and you should be
set.  You have to switch LaserEmission on each time you boot up MM and if
you use a TTL controller PeakPower will determine the laser intensity.

Blanking mode will theoretically help acquire faster with minimized light
exposure.  However I have not got that to work; Micro-Manager's
auto-shutter seems to do the job well enough.

All the best,

Dear Zheng,

I too use an Andor camera and also had problems in the beginning. I followed all the steps listed here first (http://openspim.org/64bit_OpenSPIM). The drivers work if installed in the OpenSPIM directory and when loading into the config choose the Andor SDK option. The C-states can also be named slightly different in your BIOS settings depending on the make of your PC. The PCI card that Andor provide is essential, you need to run the camera through the card if you have a USB 3.0 model otherwise it definitely won?t load into the configuration.

If you have done all these, I contacted the Andor support and they are extremely helpful in helping out. They also updated the camera firmware through a remote session.

As for the update error, I find downloading a fresh OpenSPIM and updating from scratch sometimes helps.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Subject: [OpenSPIM] MicroManager error when configure an andor camera

Hi, all
     Does anyone use andor camera? I wanted to change my camera to an andor camera. But the micro-manager crashed when I configured the camera.  The SPIM software is 64bit. And there is a error log(see the attachment). Besides, the camera can be used by its owned software correctly.
     I tried to update the OpenSPIM. However, the OpenSPIM reported error every time when you started it, and could not be updated.

Dear Neil,

First of all, I have to say that I am so sorry for the late reply.

I am trying to explain as possible as I can.

For completeness, I've cc'd the openspim list, and for reference our last conversation was part of a thread called "Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF packages?" that I hijacked at the start of the year.

One thing that I'm not sure about is the location of the code that builds the GUI form.  In other code I see the option to show the design of the form in Netbeans, but I don't see that here.  Is the GUI programmatically created without IDE assistance?  If so, how hard would it be to pull that into a form design type file in Netbeans?  It really speeds up my understanding of the code if I can quickly reference the buttons and sliders etc. in the exploration and debug stages.
Unfortunately, SPIMAcquisition builds GUI programmatically and lack of comments on this part. Personally, I would like to remove all the unnecessary GUI parts except ?Acquisition?. However, I cannot check whether all those things are still being used by users or not, and there are differently associated tasks(video recording, etc) depending on which tab selected. My idea to handle your case is that you can build your own Tab including your controls or add ?Customize? button to open your customized panel by ?clicking? event. Then, you can manage to implement your logics there.

> 
> You had previously asked about my direction in the plugin, and a large part of it would be to make the interface more user friendly and graphical.  My setup will be part of our core facility and I hope to have researchers here using the software once things are up and rolling.  If the GUI it is more programmatic, could you point me to that structure/code/... and maybe I could start from there.
The first thing for you to look at is "spim.SPIMAcquisition#initUI()? part, which contains long lines of codes for initializing GUI controls. I tried to make it little bit readable by ?//? and following short description for only small parts. Let me know if you have complicated codes in the file. I will explain it.

> 
> My second direction would be to add the option of different hardware to the plugin.  Would it be possible to bring some sort of modularity to the GUI, that draws from the MM hardware settings and available core options?  Alternatively, might it be easier to add to the multidimensional acquisition panel in MM by including a rotation section?  You could then call that panel from the SPIM Acquisition plugin.
That would be a really good idea if we can bring the modularity from the implemented MM parts and reuse them inside the plugin context. Actually, I have not investigated MM codes enough to be able to judge. However, it would be much nicer and compact if we can reuse the components from the MM packages. It will involve that I need study MM codes more. It is hard to tell you how much time it could be expected.

> Sorry for the my somewhat fragmented questions/suggestions.  I'm sure it'll make more sense once I get into the details, and I appreciate any pointers you can offer as I get started.
No problem! I will be always on your side. Please, let me know whenever you have questions/feedbacks regarding SPIMAcquisition plugin. I try to do my best to answer you as much as I can.

Best Regards,

HongKee

  COMMENT # 4 [2] ON BUG 1214 [1] FROM CURTIS RUEDEN

After consulting with Hongkee Moon, we discovered that the
Micro-Manager-dev
update site, used by the OpenSPIM update site, had many invalid/obsolete
duplicate libraries present in the plugins/Micro-Manager subfolder.

These duplicates interfered with the normal operations of ImageJ.

I have removed all the duplicates from the Micro-Manager-dev update
site, so
this problem should not bite others using OpenSPIM anymore -- at least
for now.

To repair your local installation, remove all
plugins/Micro-Manager/scijava-common-*.jar files from your installation.
Then
launch OpenSPIM and run the updater (which should now launch
successfully) to
update everything else.

And please feel free to reopen this issue if the problem recurs.

Hi Monika

I haven't looked into the details, but thought this kind of thing would be super low cost, and fun too:

With some thinking you might even be able to control it using the TTL (I believe 3V) from a serial LPT port if you have one.

Hey everyone,


the solution Neil suggested works *really* well and is probably as low-cost as you can get. MicroManager is even able to use Arduinos as shutter, see https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Control_laser_shutters_with_Arduino


cheers!

Monika,

I'd vote for the Arduino approach too-especially for the built in device adapter for micromanager.  A little bit of mucking about with the adapter would get you full control through the plugin.  I used this approach to integrate an AOTF.

Unless you know someone to write the device adapter for the picard shutter (they provided a dll)...

Thanks for all the advice! I guess I'll try the Arduino then, if it  
doesn't work I can still buy a proper shutter and maybe use Arduino for  
something else later.

Hi Monika,
We are looking for shutters here for an other application and found this 
one : http://marketplace.idexop.com/store/IdexCustom/PartDetails?pId=396
It's major advantage is that you don't need any controler as it is 
directly TTL driven. So with an Arduino board, or the serial control as 
shutter on Micromanager  it should work directly.
Best regards,
Frédéric

Subject: [OpenSPIM] z settle time
Message-ID: <558AD332-47DE-4FAB-B203-370FD612786A@cores.utah.edu>

Since I have two laser lines on my SPIM, I use the Micro-manager multi-dimensional acquisition function rather than the SPIM acquisition window. One problem with this is no z-settle time button. To get around this, I always acquire a transmitted image before the GFP channel to allow for the sample to settle. The problem is that this doubles my file sizes. Is there a simple way to program a delay before acquisition to allow for sample settling after z movement?

thanks
Michael Redd

Hi HongKee, I hope the code is treating you well.

Sorry for the delay; I've been pulled in a couple of different directions recently, but have been coming back to the plugin code a little more now.  For completeness, I've cc'd the openspim list, and for reference our last conversation was part of a thread called "Why do SPIM and Micro-Manager use different TIFF packages?" that I hijacked at the start of the year.

Thanks for the details on SPIMTestDrive section of the code.  It's great to now have the option to step through and figure things out.  One thing that I'm not sure about is the location of the code that builds the GUI form.  In other code I see the option to show the design of the form in Netbeans, but I don't see that here.  Is the GUI programmatically created without IDE assistance?  If so, how hard would it be to pull that into a form design type file in Netbeans?  It really speeds up my understanding of the code if I can quickly reference the buttons and sliders etc. in the exploration and debug stages.

You had previously asked about my direction in the plugin, and a large part of it would be to make the interface more user friendly and graphical.  My setup will be part of our core facility and I hope to have researchers here using the software once things are up and rolling.  If the GUI it is more programmatic, could you point me to that structure/code/... and maybe I could start from there.

My second direction would be to add the option of different hardware to the plugin.  Would it be possible to bring some sort of modularity to the GUI, that draws from the MM hardware settings and available core options?  Alternatively, might it be easier to add to the multidimensional acquisition panel in MM by including a rotation section?  You could then call that panel from the SPIM Acquisition plugin.

Sorry for the my somewhat fragmented questions/suggestions.  I'm sure it'll make more sense once I get into the details, and I appreciate any pointers you can offer as I get started.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Message-ID: <CO2PR05MB6815BC16D658672603A7B23ECA40@CO2PR05MB681.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all, I hope the scopes are treating you well.

I have a general question for all.  I haven't yet taken any data (almost everything is in place and nearly ready to roll), but I'm curious to know about the axis of rotation when rotating the sample to different views.

Maybe I'm over thinking this, or the effects of being off axis are smaller than I imagine, but I'm really curious to know how people are experiencing and counteracting this part of the acquisition.  In a perfect world my theta would rotate around an axis parallel to the y axis and the sample would be placed on the rotation axis.  I could then translate the axis into the center of my camera and z-stack and rotate from there.  In reality, I'm guessing here as you know, you'd have an axis of rotation that's tilted to some degree, and the sample would likely be off center.  This would lead to samples moving in an arc when rotating, and xyz translation required to bring the region of interest back into view on each rotation.

Any experiences or thoughts in this direction are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi Neil

here are a few thoughts:

- The rotational axis can be determined very precisely by mounting a cylinder of fluorescent beads, switching on the laser and spinning the sample. You will see a “snow storm” of beads. You keep on moving your sample in x and z until you see a line of beads that do not move. This is your rotational axis. Above this line you will see beads coming towards the lens, below away (or the other way around). You position this line of beads in your FOV’s center and call this stage position (0,y,0).

- Once you have determined the rotational axis you can find and center your sample in the FOV. (The sample will not necessarily be on the rational axis.) When your sample is in the FOV the stage position tells you how far away from the rational axis you are. Rotating now by an angle theta should go along with a translation along x and z that you can easily calculate with Sin(theta) and Cos(Theta) and the distance from the axis. The sample will now rotate around the FOV’s center. (I do not know how the openSPIM software handles this.)

- You can also build a little translational stage that allows you to reposition the sample with respect to the rotational axis (very important for OPT, useful for SPIM, see Bassi et al, Development 2015). This way you can always position the sample precisely on the rotational axis. 

- The rotational axis is never perfectly vertical (parallel to y). Generally this is not a big deal. If you want to do MV imaging you anyway need to register the data sets.

- Ideally you should have stages that are precise and reliable, i.e. they find the same position even after a few hours. Then you can image a bunch of beads from different directions at the beginning of your experiment, register the beads (Preibisch et al.) and you know once and forever how to register data from these directions. No need to embed ugly beads with your sample. Again, this assumes that you have a nice set of motors.

- It is important to understand that the registration of data is independent of the actual sample’s position. It does not matter if the FEP tube is bent, if the sample is at an angle or off-axis. The transformations necessary to register the data are solely determined by how (well) you have assembled the (hopefully precise) motors.

Hope this helps. 

Jan

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone is using a Stradus Versalase with OpenSPIM and if so i'm interested in knowing what properties of the laser are required and included in the micro-manager config group/preset.  So far i have created a Micro-Manager config file that contains all the required SPIM devices.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <D2F1E652.ABAF%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hi Matt, 

We use a 488/561 Versalase with an ESio TTL controller to enhance
switching speed.  Our setup largely followed a design that was generously
provided by Johannes Girstmair in the Telford lab at University College
London, with a few modifications to fit our needs.  He provided me
extensive help that I can pass along if he has not done already.

Overall it works quite well.  If you use a TTL controller, you will want
to add the following to the Configuration Settings window in
Micro-Manager: 

Laser_[A/B/C/D]_LaserEmission
Laser_[color]_DigitalPeakPowerSetting
TTL_State (I rename this setting 'color' and name the TTL states that
result in the desired outputs 'green', 'red' and 'off'.  This lets me set

Turn on DigitalModulation in the Device Property Browser and you should be
set.  You have to switch LaserEmission on each time you boot up MM and if
you use a TTL controller PeakPower will determine the laser intensity.

Blanking mode will theoretically help acquire faster with minimized light

Hi Matt,

We use a 488/561 Versalase with an ESio TTL controller to enhance
switching speed.  Our setup largely followed a design that was generously
provided by Johannes Girstmair in the Telford lab at University College
London, with a few modifications to fit our needs.  He provided me
extensive help that I can pass along if he has not done already.

Overall it works quite well.  If you use a TTL controller, you will want
to add the following to the Configuration Settings window in
Micro-Manager:

Laser_[A/B/C/D]_LaserEmission
Laser_[color]_DigitalPeakPowerSetting
TTL_State (I rename this setting 'color' and name the TTL states that
result in the desired outputs 'green', 'red' and 'off'.  This lets me set
multi-channel images by assigning the 'color' variable in Multi-D
Acquisition)

Turn on DigitalModulation in the Device Property Browser and you should be
set.  You have to switch LaserEmission on each time you boot up MM and if
you use a TTL controller PeakPower will determine the laser intensity.

Blanking mode will theoretically help acquire faster with minimized light
exposure.  However I have not got that to work; Micro-Manager's
auto-shutter seems to do the job well enough.

All the best,

Hi Jan, thanks for the detailed response.

I’ll look forward to taking my first data set soon and I’m sure they’ll be more posts from me to keep people updated :)

And thanks for the Bassi reference.  I like their little xy translation mount.

Subject: Re: [OpenSPIM] Rotation Axis

Hi Neil

here are a few thoughts:

- The rotational axis can be determined very precisely by mounting a cylinder of fluorescent beads, switching on the laser and spinning the sample. You will see a “snow storm” of beads. You keep on moving your sample in x and z until you see a line of beads that do not move. This is your rotational axis. Above this line you will see beads coming towards the lens, below away (or the other way around). You position this line of beads in your FOV’s center and call this stage position (0,y,0).

- Once you have determined the rotational axis you can find and center your sample in the FOV. (The sample will not necessarily be on the rational axis.) When your sample is in the FOV the stage position tells you how far away from the rational axis you are. Rotating now by an angle theta should go along with a translation along x and z that you can easily calculate with Sin(theta) and Cos(Theta) and the distance from the axis. The sample will now rotate around the FOV’s center. (I do not know how the openSPIM software handles this.)

- You can also build a little translational stage that allows you to reposition the sample with respect to the rotational axis (very important for OPT, useful for SPIM, see Bassi et al, Development 2015). This way you can always position the sample precisely on the rotational axis.

- The rotational axis is never perfectly vertical (parallel to y). Generally this is not a big deal. If you want to do MV imaging you anyway need to register the data sets.

- Ideally you should have stages that are precise and reliable, i.e. they find the same position even after a few hours. Then you can image a bunch of beads from different directions at the beginning of your experiment, register the beads (Preibisch et al.) and you know once and forever how to register data from these directions. No need to embed ugly beads with your sample. Again, this assumes that you have a nice set of motors.

- It is important to understand that the registration of data is independent of the actual sample’s position. It does not matter if the FEP tube is bent, if the sample is at an angle or off-axis. The transformations necessary to register the data are solely determined by how (well) you have assembled the (hopefully precise) motors.

Hope this helps.

Jan

Hi all, I hope the scopes are treating you well.

I have a general question for all.  I haven't yet taken any data (almost everything is in place and nearly ready to roll), but I'm curious to know about the axis of rotation when rotating the sample to different views.

Maybe I'm over thinking this, or the effects of being off axis are smaller than I imagine, but I'm really curious to know how people are experiencing and counteracting this part of the acquisition.  In a perfect world my theta would rotate around an axis parallel to the y axis and the sample would be placed on the rotation axis.  I could then translate the axis into the center of my camera and z-stack and rotate from there.  In reality, I'm guessing here as you know, you'd have an axis of rotation that's tilted to some degree, and the sample would likely be off center.  This would lead to samples moving in an arc when rotating, and xyz translation required to bring the region of interest back into view on each rotation.

Any experiences or thoughts in this direction are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Dear Zheng,

I too use an Andor camera and also had problems in the beginning. I followed all the steps listed here first (http://openspim.org/64bit_OpenSPIM). The drivers work if installed in the OpenSPIM directory and when loading into the config choose the Andor SDK option. The C-states can also be named slightly different in your BIOS settings depending on the make of your PC. The PCI card that Andor provide is essential, you need to run the camera through the card if you have a USB 3.0 model otherwise it definitely won’t load into the configuration.

If you have done all these, I contacted the Andor support and they are extremely helpful in helping out. They also updated the camera firmware through a remote session.

As for the update error, I find downloading a fresh OpenSPIM and updating from scratch sometimes helps.

Kind regards,

Dylan

One thing that I'm not sure about is the location of the code that builds the GUI form.  In other code I see the option to show the design of the form in Netbeans, but I don't see that here.  Is the GUI programmatically created without IDE assistance?  If so, how hard would it be to pull that into a form design type file in Netbeans?  It really speeds up my understanding of the code if I can quickly reference the buttons and sliders etc. in the exploration and debug stages.
Unfortunately, SPIMAcquisition builds GUI programmatically and lack of comments on this part. Personally, I would like to remove all the unnecessary GUI parts except “Acquisition”. However, I cannot check whether all those things are still being used by users or not, and there are differently associated tasks(video recording, etc) depending on which tab selected. My idea to handle your case is that you can build your own Tab including your controls or add “Customize” button to open your customized panel by “clicking” event. Then, you can manage to implement your logics there.

>

My setup will be part of our core facility and I hope to have researchers here using the software once things are up and rolling.  If the GUI it is more programmatic, could you point me to that structure/code/... and maybe I could start from there.
The first thing for you to look at is "spim.SPIMAcquisition#initUI()” part, which contains long lines of codes for initializing GUI controls. I tried to make it little bit readable by “//“ and following short description for only small parts. Let me know if you have complicated codes in the file. I will explain it.

> 
> My second direction would be to add the option of different hardware to the plugin.  Would it be possible to bring some sort of modularity to the GUI, that draws from the MM hardware settings and available core options?  Alternatively, might it be easier to add to the multidimensional acquisition panel in MM by including a rotation section?  You could then call that panel from the SPIM Acquisition plugin.
That would be a really good idea if we can bring the modularity from the implemented MM parts and reuse them inside the plugin context. Actually, I have not investigated MM codes enough to be able to judge. However, it would be much nicer and compact if we can reuse the components from the MM packages. It will involve that I need study MM codes more. It is hard to tell you how much time it could be expected.

No problem! I will be always on your side. Please, let me know whenever you have questions/feedbacks regarding SPIMAcquisition plugin. I try to do my best to answer you as much as I can.

     I just updated OpenSPIM(64bit) at Help->update. And the error happened when you restart the OpenSPIM. 


[ERROR] Module threw exception
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Context already injected: net.imagej.updater.CheckForUpdates#commandService



     If try the update again, it reported


java.lang.RuntimeException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Context already injected: net.imagej.ui.swing.updater.ImageJUpdater#statusService
	at net.imagej.legacy.LegacyService.runLegacyCompatibleCommand(LegacyService.java:274)





     Does anyone has this error ?
