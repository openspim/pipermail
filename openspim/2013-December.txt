Subject: [OpenSPIM] "Acquire SPIM image" option missing in dropdown menu
 after Fiji Update
Message-ID: <E55B3C5CC061114E817EBD3B94D0B0B3042B4E08AFEF@BMSIMBOX4.bmsi.a-star.edu.sg>

Dear All,

Have anyone encounter this problem that the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after running Fiji updates today?

The "Acquire SPIM image" option is missing in the dropdown menu in Micro-Manager after I ran Fiji update today. When I clicked on "Plugins" in the Micro-Manager's menu, the "Acquire SPIM image" option does not appear.

I had also re-downloaded the OpenSPIM/Fiji package as of October 25th, 2013. The "Acquire SPIM image" option appears normally in the Micro-Manager Plugins' menu, but it disappear after the Fiji update/restart. Sadly, I am not able to use the October 25th version as there is a camera error which is solved after the Fiji update but the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after today's Fiji update. 

Best Regards,
John

Hi Pete, no apologies needed; thanks for posting the links.

I'll keep you posted on how they work and what progresses from there.

Thanks
Neil

Hey Johannes,

I just tried that, but couldn't do it due to the wiki thinking my .STEP
(uppercase) file is empty and the wiki unable to upload .zip files...

Take a look at the screenshot attached to this message, especially to the
'Upload warning' and the 'permitted file types'.

Hello WIKIZONG,

I'm one of the software developers on the OpenSPIM project; the good news is that the Orca Flash4 is successfully being used for the OpenSPIM project, in Heidelberg -- see?http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F?.


We have also encountered this error message with Hamamatsu cameras before, usually because Fiji is taking up too much of the system's memory. Please try limiting Fiji's memory (Edit > Options > Memory & Threads...) to 1 GB or so. Additionally, this error message sometimes appears only on the first startup of Micro-Manager after booting the computer -- please try restarting Micro-Manager and see if the error message still appears.


Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg


P.S. The OpenSPIM project has a mailing list -- openspim at openspim.org -- please feel free to contact me there if you have any more trouble! :-) Additionally, the Heidelberg lab is subscribed to that mailing list, so they might be able to provide more direct and useful advice if the Flash4 is still problematic for you.

Hello Luke Stuyvenberg :
  Thanks a lot for your reply. I believe you are right cos I could use mmanager to control the flash 4 in Win7 with no trouble. But I havent try what you propose to do in XP because I think using orca Flash4.0 in WinXP is a really bad choice. That is bacause XP does not supply for USB3.0. So I have to use the firebird board to control the Flash 4.0. Somehow that discourage the whole system to be partible and portable! Right now I have successful controlled the Flash 4 and installed the acquisitonSPIM plugin with mmanager 64bit in Win7. I am waiting for the 4d-stage to assemble the whole system. I will make you informed as soon as my project make any progress!
Best,
Zong

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet
Message-ID: <OFB1EBBD2F.6D101400-ONC1257C37.004E9A94-C1257C37.004E9AAE@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

 Hi dear all,

I have made some tests about the lightsheet. I made some pictures of the lightsheet using the telescope and without using it. To be able of imaging the lightsheet I used a small mirror at 45? mounted in a sample holder to direct the lightsheet onto the CCD.

I found that the lightsheet looks narrower without using the telescope. I know that the telescope is used for alignig the lightsheet with the focal plane of the detection objective in
an easier way (adjusting the knob of the last mirror causes the lightsheet to move parallel to the plane of the detection objective without being tilted). 

I found out that also is possible to align the lightsheet without using the telescope. Then, I aligned the lightsheet rotating the knob of the mirror but also translating it (I have mounted the mirror in a rail as in this picture http://openspim.org/File:1I_1D_OpenSPIM_03.jpg ). To be sure that the lightsheet was perpendicular to the detection axis throughout the complete FOV I made some pictures of the lightsheet moving the mirror mounted in the sample holder in the X direction.

I attach the pictures to this mail. In the pictures can be observed that the lightsheet is directed to the part of the mirror mounted in the sample holder that is in focus. Even if I translate the mirror mounted in the sample holder in the X direction, the lightsheet remains on the focused part. This is the way I check that the lightsheet is perpendicular throughout the complete FOV. When the lightsheet was not completely perpendicular I observed that the lightsheet was not reflected exactly on the part in focus when moving the mirror in the X direction.

>From the pictures without using the telescope, it can be observed that the lightsheet widens in the borders of the FOV (because of the gaussian nature of the lightsheet), but in the pictures where I use the telescope, the lightsheet seems to be the same thickness along the complete FOV. 

I would like to know if what I have done is right and why does the lightsheet does not seem to change its thickness in the borders of the FOV when I use the telescope.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi John (and all),

You're quite right. A recent update to Fiji upgraded Apache Commons Math to version 3.2, which the plugin (and, in fact, Micromanager) was unprepared to use.


I've corrected the code and uploaded a new version of the plugin and associated Micro-Manager JAR files. Please update Fiji again; the problem should be resolved.


Let me know if you have any further troubles, and thank you for reporting this!

The "Acquire SPIM image" option appears normally in the Micro-Manager Plugins' menu, but it disappear after the Fiji update/restart. Sadly, I am not able to use the October 25th version as there is a camera error which is solved after the Fiji update but the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after today's Fiji update.

 Hi Jan,

I changed the order of the lens in the telescope so that it expands the beam and I got a thinner lightsheet, but when I move the mirror mounted on the sample holder in the X direction
the lightsheet expands too much. I attach some images.

Do you know if I can adjust the relationship between the thickness of the lightsheet in the center and in the borders of the FOV using the vertical slit?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Re: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet

 Hi Jan,

Yes, I am talking about the telescope between the corner mirror and the objective.

Ohh, I have thought that this telescope instead of expanding the beam, it was reducing it.
In the instructions of how to install the telescope from the OpenSPIM wiki, the 50 mm focal length lens goes first and then
the 25 mm, (the opposite order in comparisson to the beam expander). So, it looks like all this time I have been using the
wrong lens configuration. 

Concerning the pictures, I am always using the illumination objective, in some using the telescope (between the corner mirror and the objective), in others without using it.

That explain everything. I will change the order of the lenses of the last telescope in order to expand the beam and not to reduce it. Thanks a lot for your answer.
I will let you know if I suceed.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Re: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet

Hi!

hhmmm ... I pressume you're talking about the telescope between the 
corner mirror and the objective, right?

As far as I know the openSPIM, this telescope should lead to an 
additional 2-fold expansion of the beam. This means that the light fills 
more of the projection objective and should thus also create a thinner 
focus (we "use more" of the available NA of the objective ... ) ... So 
your finding of with and without the objective looks strange to me ... 
Can you measure the width of the lightsheet with your different 
configurations? It should slightly expand, if you move the 45?-mirror 
along the lightsheet axis ... How did you find the right position of the 
projection objective? We usually find a sharp line on the mirror and 
position it in the center of the FOV, then adjust the lightsheet to 
overlay with this line, using the corner mirror and finally adjust the 
projection obvjective (along the lightsheet axis) until we have the 
thinnest possible lightsheet which should then also have it's thinnest 
position in the center of the FOV.

Best,
JAN

Dear Veli-Pekka,

it was my pleasure to give the lecture in Oulu and I enjoyed my time in Finland! It's great to hear that you are moving into the SPIM field as well and I am happy to answer part of your questions. However, when it comes to software integration, I rather leave that to the guys on the mailing list, which is why I also put them on CC. 

So if I get it right you want to build a two-color setup with double-sided illumination? Do you want to detect both colors simultaneously or sequentially? And how do you plan to use the double-sided illumination, also simultaneously or sequentially?

Using a camera with a bigger sensor like sCMOS is possible and should not be limited by the microscope objective or the emission filter, so no optical redesign is necessary here. However, additional components could be problematic and block light from reaching the edges of your chip. Those components are namely camera adapters with additional (de)magnification or image splitter. On the other hand, an image splitter is a neat way to capture two colors simultaneously, especially on a big camera chip which has plenty of pixels to share. Some companies are now also modifying their splitters for sCMOS chips.
Compared to a camera with a smaller chip, you lower your effective magnification (or in other words, you increase your field of view) if you use the entire chip of an sCMOS camera. If there are components which limit the field of view (adapters, splitters), you end up with smaller useable area. But maybe that does not matter and you simply crop to the center of the chip, which would also increase your maximum frame rate. It really depends on what you want to image and which spatial and temporal resolution you wish to get.

Regarding the integration of camera and laser into the software, as I said, I am not up to date. But probably someone else from the mailing list can help here?!

Best regards,
Michael

Thanks Michael for the answers and cc?ing!

Our initial plan is to build up a SPIM with a dual side simultaneous excitation by one laser wavelength at the time, and image colors sequentially. Laser (either 488nm or 561nm) is divided into two identical illumination pathways to reduce shading and the need of rotation. So at least in the first version we have to replace the laser head between the channels. Maybe later we?ll try to modify it so that we could use two lasers installed at the same time and control the excitation wavelength with ?Manager, if that appears to be possible. Do you think it is generally worth building a two sided illumination set-up compared to single sided illumination, or can we assume some unexpected problems arising from reflections or difficulties in aligning overlapping lightsheets etc.?

So anyone please, do you have any further information about controlling Coherent OBIS lasers with OpenSpim ?Manager? I haven?t got any answers from Coherent. Would you like to share your experiences with sCMOS cameras as well?

The best place to ask is the OpenSPIM mailing list (Cc:ed). What

Message-ID: <742E1E88D2F8D44AAA2E700C6BB4FA98AFE96C@nippu1.univ.yo.oulu.fi>

Hi all,

Has anyone used Cobolt DPSS lasers in OpenSPIM? There is a nice selection of lasers with different wavelengths and output powers listed on their catalogue. Moreover, micro-manager seems to have device support for Cobolts (Cobolt Laser Controller by name). We'd be interested especially in Cobolt Dual Combiner, which allows a permanently aligned combination of any 2 wavelengths to one single output. That would be very handy in multi-color imaging. So, can anyone comment on the Cobolts and the functionality in OpenSPIM?

Hi!

we are using Cobolt DPSS lasers in a dual-color SPIM setup (not an 
openSPIM, but a comparable design: 
http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/research/spim.html and a new publication to 
appear in a few days/weeks: Krieger, Singh etal. (2013): "Dual-Color 
Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy on a Single Plane 
Illumination Microscope (SPIM-FCCS)", OPtics Express, accepted). The 
lasers are generally good, but you should care for a few things:

1. As most DPSS lasers they are stable at the specified output power, 
but might get instable if you go below 10% of that power (our 25mW 
lasers typically show a TEM20 or TEM10 mode, when driven at 1mW output 
power instead of 25mW, where they have a nice TEM00) ... but thats 
generally true for all DPSS lasers, so in oder to reduce the laser 
power, you should use neutral-density filters or waveplate+ polarizer cube.

2. The Cobolt 491nm laser is good, but has a little green light coming 
out of the cavity (a few microwatt @ ~530nm), so I would strongly advice 
a cleanup-filter. On the 561nm laser I haven't noticed anything yet.

3. A general thing on two-color illumination on a SPIM: We had some 
problems, when combining the two beams immediately behind the lasers. 
The focal points of the lasers were not overlapping (distance ~10?m), 
but then we have a very thin lightsheet (~1.5?m FWHM, i.e. NA0.3 
overilluminated) and accordingly small depth of focus. Depending on your 
application that may not be that much of a problem. Anyways we're using 
two beam expanders and combine the expanded beams. This also allows us 
to independently move the focal points along the lightsheet axis. I'm 
attatching a sketch of the setup (5x-beam expanders, 100mm/300mm relais 
telescope, 100mm cylindrical lens, 10x/NA0.3 Nikon air objective).

4. As we just replaced a ArKr laser by two DPSS lasers, I talked to a 
lot of different companies ... all the DPSS lasers are more or less 
comparable. Some are maybe spectrally a bit cleaner or slightly more 
stable, but Cobolt offers good value for the price and we are very happy 
with those guys ;-)

5. About the beam-combiner I would also have second thoughts: On the one 
hand see point 3 above and the other problem is that you can realign the 
beamcombiner (it's glued internally, so if it's missaligned at some 
point, you cannot do much), so I would simply buy a dichroic and a 
second mirror. Then you can use these two to fully align the second 
laser beam:

+---------+                \
| LASER 2 |-----------------\ mirror
+---------+                 |\
                             |
                             |
+---------+                \| dichroic
| LASER 1 |-----------------\==============> SPIM
+---------+                  \

Here you can align the SPIM first with laser 1 and then use the mirror 
and dichroic (both on kinematic mirror mounts) to align the second laser.

Hope that helps,
JAN

Hi,

we are setting up a SPIM system based on the openspim configuration with some additional features (Orca Flash 4, 3 lasers and emission filter Wheel). We are in the process of purchasing lasers and I have some questions:

1. What is your opinion when it comes to the power of lasermodules. I noted that Jan Krieger in a recent mail pointed out the DPSS lasers could be flucturating once below 10% of their nominal power. We are going to use them for analysis of zebrafish larvae and what is a typical power setting for running these kind of experiments.

2. Fiberconnected or open beam. Your opinions.

3. Beamcombiners (light hub Sole or similar) or seperate lasers? Other than Jan that have similar experiences of problems with alignment.

4. AOTF module or not?

Your input is highly appreciated. 

Thanks!

Thanks Jan for your comprehensive reply!

This helps a lot and gives many aspects to think about. What is the operating software you are using? ?Manager or something else, and how well these lasers integrate with the software?

Subject: Re: [OpenSPIM] Cobolt lasers in OpenSPIM?

Hi!

we are using Cobolt DPSS lasers in a dual-color SPIM setup (not an openSPIM, but a comparable design: 
http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/research/spim.html and a new publication to appear in a few days/weeks: Krieger, Singh etal. (2013): "Dual-Color Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy on a Single Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM-FCCS)", OPtics Express, accepted). The lasers are generally good, but you should care for a few things:

1. As most DPSS lasers they are stable at the specified output power, but might get instable if you go below 10% of that power (our 25mW lasers typically show a TEM20 or TEM10 mode, when driven at 1mW output power instead of 25mW, where they have a nice TEM00) ... but thats generally true for all DPSS lasers, so in oder to reduce the laser power, you should use neutral-density filters or waveplate+ polarizer cube.

2. The Cobolt 491nm laser is good, but has a little green light coming out of the cavity (a few microwatt @ ~530nm), so I would strongly advice a cleanup-filter. On the 561nm laser I haven't noticed anything yet.

3. A general thing on two-color illumination on a SPIM: We had some problems, when combining the two beams immediately behind the lasers. 
The focal points of the lasers were not overlapping (distance ~10?m), but then we have a very thin lightsheet (~1.5?m FWHM, i.e. NA0.3
overilluminated) and accordingly small depth of focus. Depending on your application that may not be that much of a problem. Anyways we're using two beam expanders and combine the expanded beams. This also allows us to independently move the focal points along the lightsheet axis. I'm attatching a sketch of the setup (5x-beam expanders, 100mm/300mm relais telescope, 100mm cylindrical lens, 10x/NA0.3 Nikon air objective).

4. As we just replaced a ArKr laser by two DPSS lasers, I talked to a lot of different companies ... all the DPSS lasers are more or less comparable. Some are maybe spectrally a bit cleaner or slightly more stable, but Cobolt offers good value for the price and we are very happy with those guys ;-)

5. About the beam-combiner I would also have second thoughts: On the one hand see point 3 above and the other problem is that you can realign the beamcombiner (it's glued internally, so if it's missaligned at some point, you cannot do much), so I would simply buy a dichroic and a second mirror. Then you can use these two to fully align the second laser beam:

+---------+                \
| LASER 2 |-----------------\ mirror
+---------+                 |\
                             |
                             |
+---------+                \| dichroic
| LASER 1 |-----------------\==============> SPIM
+---------+                  \

Here you can align the SPIM first with laser 1 and then use the mirror and dichroic (both on kinematic mirror mounts) to align the second laser.

Hope that helps,
JAN

Thanks Michael for the answers and cc?ing!

Our initial plan is to build up a SPIM with a dual side simultaneous excitation by one laser wavelength at the time, and image colors sequentially. Laser (either 488nm or 561nm) is divided into two identical illumination pathways to reduce shading and the need of rotation. So at least in the first version we have to replace the laser head between the channels. Maybe later we?ll try to modify it so that we could use two lasers installed at the same time and control the excitation wavelength with ?Manager, if that appears to be possible. Do you think it is generally worth building a two sided illumination set-up compared to single sided illumination, or can we assume some unexpected problems arising from reflections or difficulties in aligning overlapping lightsheets etc.?

So anyone please, do you have any further information about controlling Coherent OBIS lasers with OpenSpim ?Manager? I haven?t got any answers from Coherent. Would you like to share your experiences with sCMOS cameras as well?

Dear Veli-Pekka,

it was my pleasure to give the lecture in Oulu and I enjoyed my time in Finland! It's great to hear that you are moving into the SPIM field as well and I am happy to answer part of your questions. However, when it comes to software integration, I rather leave that to the guys on the mailing list, which is why I also put them on CC.

So if I get it right you want to build a two-color setup with double-sided illumination? Do you want to detect both colors simultaneously or sequentially? And how do you plan to use the double-sided illumination, also simultaneously or sequentially?

Using a camera with a bigger sensor like sCMOS is possible and should not be limited by the microscope objective or the emission filter, so no optical redesign is necessary here. However, additional components could be problematic and block light from reaching the edges of your chip. Those components are namely camera adapters with additional (de)magnification or image splitter. On the other hand, an image splitter is a neat way to capture two colors simultaneously, especially on a big camera chip which has plenty of pixels to share. Some companies are now also modifying their splitters for sCMOS chips.
Compared to a camera with a smaller chip, you lower your effective magnification (or in other words, you increase your field of view) if you use the entire chip of an sCMOS camera. If there are components which limit the field of view (adapters, splitters), you end up with smaller useable area. But maybe that does not matter and you simply crop to the center of the chip, which would also increase your maximum frame rate. It really depends on what you want to image and which spatial and temporal resolution you wish to get.

Regarding the integration of camera and laser into the software, as I said, I am not up to date. But probably someone else from the mailing list can help here?!

Best regards,
Michael

Hi Frederik,

here are my thoughts.

I agree that running DPSS lasers on low power is not ideal, they get unstable and the beam profile gets worse. But you can always install a neutral density filter in your illumination path, so that should not be an issue. Or you use an AOTF anyway. The laser power necessary for your experiment depends on a lot of factors: how the illumination path is set up, how sensitive your camera is, how bright your signal is and so on. Around 50 mW out of the laser/fiber per illumination side should typically be enough for normal imaging of fluorescent proteins in zebrafish with light sheet microscopy. But a bit more does never harm.

Fiber-coupling allows you to "quickly" swap lasers without complete realignment and increases beam quality, which is nice for diode lasers but typically not needed for DPSS or gas lasers. But you lose some power in the fiber. From my experience, open beam setups are more stable over time, whereas fiber couplers can drift over time or because of temperature changes.

Laser units are nice to have, you have everything in one box and can call the service if power drops or something does not work. Definitely nice for multi-user environment. On the other hand they are more expensive and might not have exactly the laser lines / powers you want.

I like AOTFs, they add a lot of comfort, are fast and reliable. But they do require precise alignment and add cost to the system. A cheap alternative are neutral density filters (e.g. in a filter wheel) plus shutters, although shutters are not as fast and wear out over time.

Good luck with your setup!

Michael

We use our own software QuickFit 3 
(http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/), which is kind of optimized for 
our setup and application (SPIM-FCS). There are drivers for the CObolt 
lasers, and Andor EMCCD cameras (NOT for the sCMOS, as they use the SDK 
3), but new drivers can always be written in C++. The whole application 
is multi-platform, i.e. we run our instrument on Linux and the data eval 
typically on windows. It's written in C++ and uses Qt 4.8 for the GUI.

But I think that using ?Manager may probably be easier for you ... also 
the community is larger ;-)

One more thing on the beam expanders: As first beam expanders, we use 
commercial units (one is a zoom expander 1x-8x from sill optics, the 
other one is a fixed 5x from Qioptic/Linos), which are both NOT 
achromatically corrected. So this might be part of our problem ... but 
then having the possibility to tune both lasers independently might be 
worth thinking about. At least for our application (single-cell imaging 
with a thin lightsheet) it helps a lot!

Best,
JAN

Hi Frederik,

here are my thoughts.

I agree that running DPSS lasers on low power is not ideal, they get unstable and the beam profile gets worse. But you can always install a neutral density filter in your illumination path, so that should not be an issue. Or you use an AOTF anyway. The laser power necessary for your experiment depends on a lot of factors: how the illumination path is set up, how sensitive your camera is, how bright your signal is and so on. Around 50 mW out of the laser/fiber per illumination side should typically be enough for normal imaging of fluorescent proteins in zebrafish with light sheet microscopy. But a bit more does never harm.

Fiber-coupling allows you to "quickly" swap lasers without complete realignment and increases beam quality, which is nice for diode lasers but typically not needed for DPSS or gas lasers. But you lose some power in the fiber. From my experience, open beam setups are more stable over time, whereas fiber couplers can drift over time or because of temperature changes.

Laser units are nice to have, you have everything in one box and can call the service if power drops or something does not work. Definitely nice for multi-user environment. On the other hand they are more expensive and might not have exactly the laser lines / powers you want.

I like AOTFs, they add a lot of comfort, are fast and reliable. But they do require precise alignment and add cost to the system. A cheap alternative are neutral density filters (e.g. in a filter wheel) plus shutters, although shutters are not as fast and wear out over time.

Good luck with your setup!

Michael

Hi,

we are setting up a SPIM system based on the openspim configuration with some additional features (Orca Flash 4, 3 lasers and emission filter Wheel). We are in the process of purchasing lasers and I have some questions:

1. What is your opinion when it comes to the power of lasermodules. I noted that Jan Krieger in a recent mail pointed out the DPSS lasers could be flucturating once below 10% of their nominal power. We are going to use them for analysis of zebrafish larvae and what is a typical power setting for running these kind of experiments.

2. Fiberconnected or open beam. Your opinions.

3. Beamcombiners (light hub Sole or similar) or seperate lasers? Other than Jan that have similar experiences of problems with alignment.

4. AOTF module or not?

Your input is highly appreciated.

Thanks!

Hi all!

tlking bout shutters ... there are several possibilities to build cheap laser shutters with different speed grades:

1. We use small servos controlled by an Arduino ... they are small, reliable and move a relatively long distance ... but they are slow
2. http://george.ph.utexas.edu/~meyrath/informal/shutter.pdf
3. ftp://ftp.artov.rm.cnr.it/incoming/ifa.rm.cnr.it/Maurizio.Viterbini/Public/chopper/RevSciInstrum_75_3077.pdf

Message-ID: <E55B3C5CC061114E817EBD3B94D0B0B3042B4E08AFEF@BMSIMBOX4.bmsi.a-star.edu.sg>

Dear All,

Have anyone encounter this problem that the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after running Fiji updates today?

The "Acquire SPIM image" option is missing in the dropdown menu in Micro-Manager after I ran Fiji update today. When I clicked on "Plugins" in the Micro-Manager's menu, the "Acquire SPIM image" option does not appear.

I had also re-downloaded the OpenSPIM/Fiji package as of October 25th, 2013. The "Acquire SPIM image" option appears normally in the Micro-Manager Plugins' menu, but it disappear after the Fiji update/restart. Sadly, I am not able to use the October 25th version as there is a camera error which is solved after the Fiji update but the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after today's Fiji update. 

Best Regards,
John

Hey Johannes,

I just tried that, but couldn't do it due to the wiki thinking my .STEP

Take a look at the screenshot attached to this message, especially to the

Hello WIKIZONG,

I'm one of the software developers on the OpenSPIM project; the good news is that the Orca Flash4 is successfully being used for the OpenSPIM project, in Heidelberg -- see http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F .


We have also encountered this error message with Hamamatsu cameras before, usually because Fiji is taking up too much of the system's memory. Please try limiting Fiji's memory (Edit > Options > Memory & Threads...) to 1 GB or so. Additionally, this error message sometimes appears only on the first startup of Micro-Manager after booting the computer -- please try restarting Micro-Manager and see if the error message still appears.


Hope this helps,
Luke Stuyvenberg


P.S. The OpenSPIM project has a mailing list -- openspim at openspim.org -- please feel free to contact me there if you have any more trouble! :-) Additionally, the Heidelberg lab is subscribed to that mailing list, so they might be able to provide more direct and useful advice if the Flash4 is still problematic for you.

Hello Luke Stuyvenberg :
  Thanks a lot for your reply. I believe you are right cos I could use mmanager to control the flash 4 in Win7 with no trouble. But I havent try what you propose to do in XP because I think using orca Flash4.0 in WinXP is a really bad choice. That is bacause XP does not supply for USB3.0. So I have to use the firebird board to control the Flash 4.0. Somehow that discourage the whole system to be partible and portable! Right now I have successful controlled the Flash 4 and installed the acquisitonSPIM plugin with mmanager 64bit in Win7. I am waiting for the 4d-stage to assemble the whole system. I will make you informed as soon as my project make any progress!
Best,
Zong

Hello WIKIZONG, 

I'm one of the software developers on the OpenSPIM project; the good news is that the Orca Flash4 is successfully being used for the OpenSPIM project, in Heidelberg -- see http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F . 


We have also encountered this error message with Hamamatsu cameras before, usually because Fiji is taking up too much of the system's memory. Please try limiting Fiji's memory (Edit > Options > Memory & Threads...) to 1 GB or so. Additionally, this error message sometimes appears only on the first startup of Micro-Manager after booting the computer -- please try restarting Micro-Manager and see if the error message still appears. 


Hope this helps, 
Luke Stuyvenberg 


P.S. The OpenSPIM project has a mailing list -- openspim at openspim.org -- please feel free to contact me there if you have any more trouble! :-) Additionally, the Heidelberg lab is subscribed to that mailing list, so they might be able to provide more direct and useful advice if the Flash4 is still problematic for you.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet
Message-ID: <OFB1EBBD2F.6D101400-ONC1257C37.004E9A94-C1257C37.004E9AAE@ipt.rwth-aachen.de>

 Hi dear all,

I have made some tests about the lightsheet. I made some pictures of the lightsheet using the telescope and without using it. To be able of imaging the lightsheet I used a small mirror at 45° mounted in a sample holder to direct the lightsheet onto the CCD.

I found that the lightsheet looks narrower without using the telescope. I know that the telescope is used for alignig the lightsheet with the focal plane of the detection objective in
an easier way (adjusting the knob of the last mirror causes the lightsheet to move parallel to the plane of the detection objective without being tilted). 

I found out that also is possible to align the lightsheet without using the telescope. Then, I aligned the lightsheet rotating the knob of the mirror but also translating it (I have mounted the mirror in a rail as in this picture http://openspim.org/File:1I_1D_OpenSPIM_03.jpg ). To be sure that the lightsheet was perpendicular to the detection axis throughout the complete FOV I made some pictures of the lightsheet moving the mirror mounted in the sample holder in the X direction.

I attach the pictures to this mail. In the pictures can be observed that the lightsheet is directed to the part of the mirror mounted in the sample holder that is in focus. Even if I translate the mirror mounted in the sample holder in the X direction, the lightsheet remains on the focused part. This is the way I check that the lightsheet is perpendicular throughout the complete FOV. When the lightsheet was not completely perpendicular I observed that the lightsheet was not reflected exactly on the part in focus when moving the mirror in the X direction.

>From the pictures without using the telescope, it can be observed that the lightsheet widens in the borders of the FOV (because of the gaussian nature of the lightsheet), but in the pictures where I use the telescope, the lightsheet seems to be the same thickness along the complete FOV. 

I would like to know if what I have done is right and why does the lightsheet does not seem to change its thickness in the borders of the FOV when I use the telescope.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi John (and all),

You're quite right. A recent update to Fiji upgraded Apache Commons Math to version 3.2, which the plugin (and, in fact, Micromanager) was unprepared to use.


I've corrected the code and uploaded a new version of the plugin and associated Micro-Manager JAR files. Please update Fiji again; the problem should be resolved.


Let me know if you have any further troubles, and thank you for reporting this!

The "Acquire SPIM image" option appears normally in the Micro-Manager Plugins' menu, but it disappear after the Fiji update/restart. Sadly, I am not able to use the October 25th version as there is a camera error which is solved after the Fiji update but the "Acquire SPIM image" option disappear after today's Fiji update.

Hi Luke,

After the Fiji update, the "Acuire SPIM image" option now appear normally in the Micro-Manager's "Plugin" dropdown menu.

Thank You.

 Hi Jan,

I changed the order of the lens in the telescope so that it expands the beam and I got a thinner lightsheet, but when I move the mirror mounted on the sample holder in the X direction
the lightsheet expands too much. I attach some images.

Do you know if I can adjust the relationship between the thickness of the lightsheet in the center and in the borders of the FOV using the vertical slit?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Re: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet

 Hi Jan,

Yes, I am talking about the telescope between the corner mirror and the objective.

Ohh, I have thought that this telescope instead of expanding the beam, it was reducing it.
In the instructions of how to install the telescope from the OpenSPIM wiki, the 50 mm focal length lens goes first and then
the 25 mm, (the opposite order in comparisson to the beam expander). So, it looks like all this time I have been using the
wrong lens configuration. 

Concerning the pictures, I am always using the illumination objective, in some using the telescope (between the corner mirror and the objective), in others without using it.

That explain everything. I will change the order of the lenses of the last telescope in order to expand the beam and not to reduce it. Thanks a lot for your answer.
I will let you know if I suceed.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Re: [OpenSPIM] About the lightsheet

Hi!

hhmmm ... I pressume you're talking about the telescope between the 
corner mirror and the objective, right?

As far as I know the openSPIM, this telescope should lead to an 
additional 2-fold expansion of the beam. This means that the light fills 
more of the projection objective and should thus also create a thinner 
focus (we "use more" of the available NA of the objective ... ) ... So 
your finding of with and without the objective looks strange to me ... 
Can you measure the width of the lightsheet with your different 
configurations? It should slightly expand, if you move the 45°-mirror 
along the lightsheet axis ... How did you find the right position of the 
projection objective? We usually find a sharp line on the mirror and 
position it in the center of the FOV, then adjust the lightsheet to 
overlay with this line, using the corner mirror and finally adjust the 
projection obvjective (along the lightsheet axis) until we have the 
thinnest possible lightsheet which should then also have it's thinnest 
position in the center of the FOV.

Best,
JAN

Dear Veli-Pekka,

it was my pleasure to give the lecture in Oulu and I enjoyed my time in Finland! It's great to hear that you are moving into the SPIM field as well and I am happy to answer part of your questions. However, when it comes to software integration, I rather leave that to the guys on the mailing list, which is why I also put them on CC. 

So if I get it right you want to build a two-color setup with double-sided illumination? Do you want to detect both colors simultaneously or sequentially? And how do you plan to use the double-sided illumination, also simultaneously or sequentially?

Using a camera with a bigger sensor like sCMOS is possible and should not be limited by the microscope objective or the emission filter, so no optical redesign is necessary here. However, additional components could be problematic and block light from reaching the edges of your chip. Those components are namely camera adapters with additional (de)magnification or image splitter. On the other hand, an image splitter is a neat way to capture two colors simultaneously, especially on a big camera chip which has plenty of pixels to share. Some companies are now also modifying their splitters for sCMOS chips.
Compared to a camera with a smaller chip, you lower your effective magnification (or in other words, you increase your field of view) if you use the entire chip of an sCMOS camera. If there are components which limit the field of view (adapters, splitters), you end up with smaller useable area. But maybe that does not matter and you simply crop to the center of the chip, which would also increase your maximum frame rate. It really depends on what you want to image and which spatial and temporal resolution you wish to get.

Regarding the integration of camera and laser into the software, as I said, I am not up to date. But probably someone else from the mailing list can help here?!

Thanks Michael for the answers and cc’ing!

Our initial plan is to build up a SPIM with a dual side simultaneous excitation by one laser wavelength at the time, and image colors sequentially. Laser (either 488nm or 561nm) is divided into two identical illumination pathways to reduce shading and the need of rotation. So at least in the first version we have to replace the laser head between the channels. Maybe later we’ll try to modify it so that we could use two lasers installed at the same time and control the excitation wavelength with µManager, if that appears to be possible. Do you think it is generally worth building a two sided illumination set-up compared to single sided illumination, or can we assume some unexpected problems arising from reflections or difficulties in aligning overlapping lightsheets etc.?

So anyone please, do you have any further information about controlling Coherent OBIS lasers with OpenSpim µManager? I haven’t got any answers from Coherent. Would you like to share your experiences with sCMOS cameras as well?

Dear Veli-Pekka,

it was my pleasure to give the lecture in Oulu and I enjoyed my time in Finland! It's great to hear that you are moving into the SPIM field as well and I am happy to answer part of your questions. However, when it comes to software integration, I rather leave that to the guys on the mailing list, which is why I also put them on CC.

So if I get it right you want to build a two-color setup with double-sided illumination? Do you want to detect both colors simultaneously or sequentially? And how do you plan to use the double-sided illumination, also simultaneously or sequentially?

The best place to ask is the OpenSPIM mailing list (Cc:ed). What

Message-ID: <742E1E88D2F8D44AAA2E700C6BB4FA98AFE96C@nippu1.univ.yo.oulu.fi>

Hi all,

Has anyone used Cobolt DPSS lasers in OpenSPIM? There is a nice selection of lasers with different wavelengths and output powers listed on their catalogue. Moreover, micro-manager seems to have device support for Cobolts (Cobolt Laser Controller by name). We'd be interested especially in Cobolt Dual Combiner, which allows a permanently aligned combination of any 2 wavelengths to one single output. That would be very handy in multi-color imaging. So, can anyone comment on the Cobolts and the functionality in OpenSPIM?

Hi!

we are using Cobolt DPSS lasers in a dual-color SPIM setup (not an 
openSPIM, but a comparable design: 
http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/research/spim.html and a new publication to 
appear in a few days/weeks: Krieger, Singh etal. (2013): "Dual-Color 
Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy on a Single Plane 
Illumination Microscope (SPIM-FCCS)", OPtics Express, accepted). The 
lasers are generally good, but you should care for a few things:

1. As most DPSS lasers they are stable at the specified output power, 
but might get instable if you go below 10% of that power (our 25mW 
lasers typically show a TEM20 or TEM10 mode, when driven at 1mW output 
power instead of 25mW, where they have a nice TEM00) ... but thats 
generally true for all DPSS lasers, so in oder to reduce the laser 
power, you should use neutral-density filters or waveplate+ polarizer cube.

2. The Cobolt 491nm laser is good, but has a little green light coming 
out of the cavity (a few microwatt @ ~530nm), so I would strongly advice 
a cleanup-filter. On the 561nm laser I haven't noticed anything yet.

3. A general thing on two-color illumination on a SPIM: We had some 
problems, when combining the two beams immediately behind the lasers. 
The focal points of the lasers were not overlapping (distance ~10µm), 
but then we have a very thin lightsheet (~1.5µm FWHM, i.e. NA0.3 
overilluminated) and accordingly small depth of focus. Depending on your 
application that may not be that much of a problem. Anyways we're using 
two beam expanders and combine the expanded beams. This also allows us 
to independently move the focal points along the lightsheet axis. I'm 
attatching a sketch of the setup (5x-beam expanders, 100mm/300mm relais 
telescope, 100mm cylindrical lens, 10x/NA0.3 Nikon air objective).

4. As we just replaced a ArKr laser by two DPSS lasers, I talked to a 
lot of different companies ... all the DPSS lasers are more or less 
comparable. Some are maybe spectrally a bit cleaner or slightly more 
stable, but Cobolt offers good value for the price and we are very happy 
with those guys ;-)

5. About the beam-combiner I would also have second thoughts: On the one 
hand see point 3 above and the other problem is that you can realign the 
beamcombiner (it's glued internally, so if it's missaligned at some 
point, you cannot do much), so I would simply buy a dichroic and a 
second mirror. Then you can use these two to fully align the second 
laser beam:

+---------+                \
| LASER 2 |-----------------\ mirror
+---------+                 |\
                             |
                             |
+---------+                \| dichroic
| LASER 1 |-----------------\==============> SPIM
+---------+                  \

Here you can align the SPIM first with laser 1 and then use the mirror 
and dichroic (both on kinematic mirror mounts) to align the second laser.

Hope that helps,
JAN

Hi,

we are setting up a SPIM system based on the openspim configuration with some additional features (Orca Flash 4, 3 lasers and emission filter Wheel). We are in the process of purchasing lasers and I have some questions:

1. What is your opinion when it comes to the power of lasermodules. I noted that Jan Krieger in a recent mail pointed out the DPSS lasers could be flucturating once below 10% of their nominal power. We are going to use them for analysis of zebrafish larvae and what is a typical power setting for running these kind of experiments.

2. Fiberconnected or open beam. Your opinions.

3. Beamcombiners (light hub Sole or similar) or seperate lasers? Other than Jan that have similar experiences of problems with alignment.

4. AOTF module or not?

Your input is highly appreciated. 

Thanks!

So we’d like to use Coherent OBIS-series lasers instead of CUBE (to get the 561 nm laser as well), and in one mailing list thread you and Peter Pitrone discussed that OBIS and other series have been used successfully in OpenSPIM. µManager has drivers for CUBE, but not a clear support for OBIS, so do you know how replacing the lasers should work? Another question is related on the camera. We’d like to use Orca-Flash 4 (or Andor Zyla 5.5) camera and we are mainly aware of the camera-drivers-computer –related things, but do you know how people have fitted this larger sensor type camera to the detection pathway? Do we need some optical redesign to fill the whole sensor area, or is that smaller sensor size Orca-ER just “cropping” the signal and the original pathway design would fill the larger chip as well? Of course I could reform and write these questions to the mailing list if you prefer?

Best Regards,
Veli-Pekka

Hey Veli-Pekka,

This sucks!! They have a good selection of wavelengths too... I wonder if
there is anything we can do.

Have a nice weekend and a Merry Christmas/Happy New Year!!

Hi Frederik,

here are my thoughts.

I agree that running DPSS lasers on low power is not ideal, they get unstable and the beam profile gets worse. But you can always install a neutral density filter in your illumination path, so that should not be an issue. Or you use an AOTF anyway. The laser power necessary for your experiment depends on a lot of factors: how the illumination path is set up, how sensitive your camera is, how bright your signal is and so on. Around 50 mW out of the laser/fiber per illumination side should typically be enough for normal imaging of fluorescent proteins in zebrafish with light sheet microscopy. But a bit more does never harm.

Fiber-coupling allows you to "quickly" swap lasers without complete realignment and increases beam quality, which is nice for diode lasers but typically not needed for DPSS or gas lasers. But you lose some power in the fiber. From my experience, open beam setups are more stable over time, whereas fiber couplers can drift over time or because of temperature changes.

Laser units are nice to have, you have everything in one box and can call the service if power drops or something does not work. Definitely nice for multi-user environment. On the other hand they are more expensive and might not have exactly the laser lines / powers you want.

I like AOTFs, they add a lot of comfort, are fast and reliable. But they do require precise alignment and add cost to the system. A cheap alternative are neutral density filters (e.g. in a filter wheel) plus shutters, although shutters are not as fast and wear out over time.

Good luck with your setup!

Michael

We use our own software QuickFit 3 
(http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/), which is kind of optimized for 
our setup and application (SPIM-FCS). There are drivers for the CObolt 
lasers, and Andor EMCCD cameras (NOT for the sCMOS, as they use the SDK 
3), but new drivers can always be written in C++. The whole application 
is multi-platform, i.e. we run our instrument on Linux and the data eval 
typically on windows. It's written in C++ and uses Qt 4.8 for the GUI.

But I think that using µManager may probably be easier for you ... also 
the community is larger ;-)

One more thing on the beam expanders: As first beam expanders, we use 
commercial units (one is a zoom expander 1x-8x from sill optics, the 
other one is a fixed 5x from Qioptic/Linos), which are both NOT 
achromatically corrected. So this might be part of our problem ... but 
then having the possibility to tune both lasers independently might be 
worth thinking about. At least for our application (single-cell imaging 
with a thin lightsheet) it helps a lot!

Best,
JAN
