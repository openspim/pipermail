<PRE>Hi Carsten,

After running the command `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`, the 
`target/dependency/` directory will contain all dependencies that were 
required to compile the SPIMAcquisition plugin. It is safe to assume 
that all of them are required by the plugin to work in its entirety. The 
only reason not to copy them all wholesale into the `mmplugins/` 
directory is that some of the dependencies are available in 
Micro-Manager already, in different versions.

If you want to go the hard route, it might be wiser not to start without 
additional dependencies and copying one by one based on exceptions 
printed in the console output, but instead to determine for every single 
.jar file in `target/dependency/` whether it needs to be copied. If 
there is already a version in the Micro-Manager directory (or its 
subdirectories), it does not need to be copied -- indeed, it might make 
functions fail if you do so. As an example, the ij-1.*.jar file does not 
need to be copied because there is already an ij.jar file in 
Micro-Manager's top-level directory. Likewise, the commons-math and 
commons-math3 .jar files are already present in plugins/Micro-Manager/.

In general, it might have made more sense to start with a Fiji 
installation, follow the Micro-Manager-dev update site and copy the 
SPIMAcquisition .jar file, as I had suggested originally.

Ciao,
Johannes
