<PRE>Hi Rob,

It seems like you have two distinct problems.

On Tue, Feb 10, 2015 at 11:39:31AM -0700, Robert_Kon wrote:

</I>
The best place to ask this question is the OpenSPIM mailing list (Cc'd).

&gt;<i> I haven't added my coherent obis laser to the system as similarly I come up
</I>&gt;<i> with another error when I try to add that:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Error in device 'coherent obis': Serial command failed. Is the device

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which I do not really get the question here it's trying to ask. At the
</I>&gt;<i> moment it is there is a USB to the control unit and not the laser. So I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to know whether the USB needs to do directly to the laser instead? Or
</I>&gt;<i> whether there is some other underlying issue here. 
</I>
&gt;<i>From looking at the problem report that you sent separately, it appears
</I>that the error is the result of not setting the OBIS device's Port when
adding it in the Hardware Configuration Wizard. You need to set Port to
the appropriate COM port.

I'm not sure how the OBIS USB interface works (and cannot easily check
online at the moment), but I think the OBIS controllers that work with
Micro-Manager either have a serial (RS-232) port, or their USB port
works as a virtual serial port (i.e. shows up as a COM port when plugged
in). If it is the latter, you should see a COM port that can be selected
for Port (and it should appear only when the controller is connected to
the computer, though you will need to restart Micro-Manager for changes
to be recognized).

Also note that the baudrate needs to be set to 115200, as noted on our
device page (<A HREF="https://micro-manager.org/wiki/CoherentOBIS">https://micro-manager.org/wiki/CoherentOBIS</A>).

Hope this helps.

Best,
Mark
