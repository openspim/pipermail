We are talking about starting Micro-Manager (not Fiji), right?

First, you have to find out where Micro-Manager was installed.

The easiest way to find out used to be to right-click on the 
Micro-Manager icon (either on the Desktop or in the Start Menu) and 
select &quot;Properties&quot;. The window that pops up should show the working 
directory as well as the executable, but at least in my Windows version, 
it only says &quot;(multiple values)&quot; and tells me no more.

Absent that information, you need to either remember where you installed 
it, or find the installation location. In my setup, it is C:\Program 
Files\Micro-Manager-1.4 (the default).

Next, you need to edit the `ImageJ.cfg` file in that directory (it might 
be generated only after you started Micro-Manager for the first time). 
In the second line, it says something about a &quot;javaw.exe&quot;. To see the 
command-line output, you will have to change that to &quot;java.exe&quot; (i.e. 
remove the &quot;w&quot;), for example by directing your Windows Explorer to the 
Micro-Manager directory, right-clicking on the `ImageJ.cfg` icon, 
selecting &quot;Open With&quot; from the context menu and opting to edit with 
Notepad.

After that, start Micro-Manager and you will see a command-line window 
pop up that gives you a metric ton of information. Typically, you will 
want to extend the buffer by right-clicking on the window icon on the 
left of the window's title bar, open the Properties from the context 
menu, and increase the &quot;Buffer Size&quot; in the &quot;Command History&quot; group of 
the &quot;Options&quot; tab from its ridiculous &quot;50&quot; to something more appropriate 
(I chose 5000 here). That will allow you to scroll back and read 
information that whizzed by too fast.

If you were talking about Fiji instead, have a look here to find out how 
to run from the command-line: <A HREF="http://fiji.sc/Command-Line_Debugging.">http://fiji.sc/Command-Line_Debugging.</A>

Ciao,
