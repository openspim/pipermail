Hi Friedrich,

thanks for improving http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F with your
setup!

I hope you do not mind that I added some whitespace so it does not look as
if your setup was Dresden's (whose photo may be added this week, or next).

Ciao,

Message-ID: <6f2c17308f1cb25a42c2a0e16ff83731@cam.ac.uk>

dear open spim users,

i am using the spim at cambridge university and am facing a problem with 
my time-lapse experiments.
since i last updated the software, an extra folder is automatically 
saved in addition to the wanted z-scans. the folder is called "diffs" 
and contains subfolders named e.g. 
"XYZ4366.50x1479.00x588.00_Theta0.00". the subfolders contain 3dimages 
as tiff-files. since this happens, the time-lapse is regularly abborted 
and i get an error message saying "device timed out".
does anyone know how to disable the autosaving of these extra files? i 
couldn't find it anywhere.

thanks a lot and best wishes,

stephanie

That looks great!
Would you mind sharing the details of your modifications?  Would that be 
something that can be added to the wiki?

Sorry, that must be a version with debugging stuff in it that has slipped
through. The major problem with that is that our principal software
engineer is currently traveling (working on OpenSPIM) and will only have
time to address this issue in about a week.

Sorry again!

Stephanie,

The files you refer to are saved by the anti-drift feature to give system operators some idea of the sample's drift over time. Unless saving to a slow hard drive or over a network, their creation really shouldn't cause a timeout; this may not be the cause of your errors. Still, I agree that the saving of these images should be optional; I'll add a ticket to our bugtracker and attend to it as soon as I have time.


Device timeouts usually occur with either low stage velocities (1-3) or deep stacks (500+ um?): the stage motors spend too long moving from one location to another, and Micro-Manager assumes they've stopped working. Please try enabling the "Override Timeout" feature. The checkbox is located on the bottom of the Acquisition tab; check the box, then enter a new device timeout in milliseconds. The default is 5000ms; try increasing this to 15000 or so. (I often use this feature when imaging as insurance against these errors.)


Hope this is helpful!

Hi Johannes,

I'm sorry, I was actually refering to the changes you made to the 
standard OpenSPIM setup.  I'm curious to know what parts you changed, 
why, and how it worked out.  Maybe you could share the part numbers and 
CAD files you used to make it easier for others to adapt their SPIM 
build to suit their needs?

I was then thinking that there could be a link on the wiki for people to 
access those details.

Thanks
Neil

Hi Neil,

About the changes made to our OpenSPIM setup at Fraunhofer IPT, there are 
two main changes:

*The redesign of the sample arm of the 4D Stage so that a timing belt and 
timing pulleys can be used instead
of the round belt and pulleys included with the 4D Stage. This was done 
because a slip between the belt
and pulleys was identified causing inaccuracies when rotating the sample. 
I don't know if someone else had this issue, 

*The redesign of the sample chamber so that the temperature of the medium 
can be controlled. For doing that a 
PT100 special for liquids, TO220 resistors and a PID controller were 
employed. The sample chamber had to
be built out of stainless steel so that  corrosive effects due to the 
sample medium can be avoided.

I can provide you the drawings and the CAD files, also the part number and 
manufacturer of the components that
were used,  just let me organize the information accordingly.

I think that would make sense to make this information available through 
the OpenSPIM wiki so that eveyone can use it if interested. 
At the same time I could have a feedback about the changes I made and 
further improvements can be done to the design. What is 
the opinion of all?

Best regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

This is great, and would be very useful to put all this information on the OpenSPIM page. Could you send details on all when you have? I'm also interested in more information on your modifications to the sample arm. We would be interested in this. Did you discuss this with Jean Depatie from Picard? Be good to make sure any issues are addressed for new systems they ship.

I haven't noticed any trouble with belt slippage, but it's good to know 
this may be a problem (and moreover that there is an excellent solution 
available.)

This is great stuff. Do you know off-hand if these devices are stable 
over time? i.e. four hours, eight, twenty-four? I suspect good 
temperature control may improve time-lapse recording somewhat...

By all means! That's what the wiki is there for, after all.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM 64-bit [0000129]
Message-ID: <20140131022421.5wu62ak3kw0sw408@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hi everyone,

I am currently trying to compile OpenSPIM on a 64 bit machine running  
Windows 7. While I was able to get it to compile by modifying some of  
the build scripts; upon trying to open it from Fiji, I get the  
following error

Error: Failed to open libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilib
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V

Anyone has any idea where the above error could be originating from?

I would like to mention a couple of things that I did in case they  
could be relevant to the above error
1) I combined the compiled files with a manually downloaded 64-bit Fiji.
2) I had to add a reference to commons-math3-3.2.jar in many ant  
buildfiles in order to get it to compile.

Thanks,
Nikul

Hi Kevin,

Is great to know that the modifications I made will be helpful not only to me. I already talk to Jean Depaties from Picard Industries adressing the problem I experienced with the rotational movement.
He offered me to solve the issue (image attached), but of course would imply more costs and time, so I decided to find a way to use a timing belt or a chain to tramsmit the rotational movement. 
I already tested the rotational movement and works pretty fine.

I will let know Jean Depatie about my modification, and that it worked pretty good. Maybe he agree to change the sample arm for the new systems that Picard Industries ship.

Attached to this mail is a zip file containing some description of my modifications (sample arm and SPIM chamber) and all the information necessary to reproduce them.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Edgar,

This is great, and would be very useful to put all this information on the OpenSPIM page. Could you send details on all when you have? I'm also interested in more information on your modifications to the sample arm. We would be interested in this. Did you discuss this with Jean Depatie from Picard? Be good to make sure any issues are addressed for new systems they ship.


best

Hi Luke,

I have not tested yet the temperature-controlled SPIM chamber for long periods of time, but of course, the idea of this modification is to improve the conditions of
the sample during long-term experiments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Trying to have a look at the OpenSPIM application in action.  Downloaded the zip and updated as directed.  Ran the 32 bit version as well as 64 bit (which appeared after running the Fiji updater).  In both cases, starting Micro-Manager from the Fiji plugin menu throws an error stating that libMMCoreJ_wrap is not found.  

Any ideas how to run the software?

Thanks!

Nico

My guess is that the libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilib is compiled as a 32-bit
library. Possible?

Thanks for trying! Did you do that on a MacOSX computer? So far, we only
support 32-bit Windows, but 64-bit Windows is on the list...

The primary documentation how to build Micro-Manager on Windows is here:
http://micro-manager.org/wiki/Building_MM_on_Windows

I have not found any more information how to build 64-bit Micro-Manager,
but I have a strong feeling that inspecting the file Micro-Manager tries
to load (which should be listed in the log Micro-Manager writes). Either
it is the wrong architecture, or it is in the wrong place, that's my
guess.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

That's possible as all I did was to change the platform to x64 in the build script. Can you point me to which project does that library correspond to so I can investigate whether the correct flag is being passed while compiling it?

Thanks,
Nikul

Hi Nikul,

--x64 is supposed to change "mm.architecture" to "x64" before calling Micro-Manager's build scripts; this should build MM in 64-bit. However, it's entirely probable that "build.sh" and/or "openspim.build.xml" do not copy the 64-bit files -- I would check first to see if the relevant binaries exist in "stage" or "build" subdirectories. If so, you'll have to look through the build system to see where we stage this files (I believe the relevant target is near the end of "openspim.build.xml") and make sure the correct architecture is copied from.


Hope this helps,
Luke

Hey Nico,

I haven't tested the set-up process on anything other than WinXP 32-bit. It sounds like Fiji (intelligently) attempted to replace the 32-bit version with a 64-bit version (as it's running in a 64-bit environment).


It might help to check the advanced updater panel, and look at "Only files from the 'OpenSPIM' update site", to make sure that MMCoreJ_wrap.dll is up-to-date.


Let me know if this helps,
Luke?

I'll look into it and get back. If it works, it will be great to have some resource
on the OpenSPIM website for compiling it in 64-bit.

dear open spim users,

i am using the spim at cambridge university and am facing a problem with 
my time-lapse experiments.
since i last updated the software, an extra folder is automatically 
saved in addition to the wanted z-scans. the folder is called "diffs" 
and contains subfolders named e.g. 
"XYZ4366.50x1479.00x588.00_Theta0.00". the subfolders contain 3dimages 
as tiff-files. since this happens, the time-lapse is regularly abborted 
and i get an error message saying "device timed out".
does anyone know how to disable the autosaving of these extra files? i 
couldn't find it anywhere.

thanks a lot and best wishes,

stephanie

Sorry, that must be a version with debugging stuff in it that has slipped
through. The major problem with that is that our principal software
engineer is currently traveling (working on OpenSPIM) and will only have
time to address this issue in about a week.

Sorry again!

Stephanie,

The files you refer to are saved by the anti-drift feature to give system operators some idea of the sample's drift over time. Unless saving to a slow hard drive or over a network, their creation really shouldn't cause a timeout; this may not be the cause of your errors. Still, I agree that the saving of these images should be optional; I'll add a ticket to our bugtracker and attend to it as soon as I have time.


Device timeouts usually occur with either low stage velocities (1-3) or deep stacks (500+ um?): the stage motors spend too long moving from one location to another, and Micro-Manager assumes they've stopped working. Please try enabling the "Override Timeout" feature. The checkbox is located on the bottom of the Acquisition tab; check the box, then enter a new device timeout in milliseconds. The default is 5000ms; try increasing this to 15000 or so. (I often use this feature when imaging as insurance against these errors.)


Hope this is helpful!

Hi Johannes,

I'm sorry, I was actually refering to the changes you made to the 
standard OpenSPIM setup.  I'm curious to know what parts you changed, 
why, and how it worked out.  Maybe you could share the part numbers and 
CAD files you used to make it easier for others to adapt their SPIM 
build to suit their needs?

I was then thinking that there could be a link on the wiki for people to 
access those details.

Thanks
Neil

Hey everyone,

Kevin and I were just talking -- has anyone else tried the Stradus laser?

Hi Neil,

About the changes made to our OpenSPIM setup at Fraunhofer IPT, there are 
two main changes:

*The redesign of the sample arm of the 4D Stage so that a timing belt and 
timing pulleys can be used instead
of the round belt and pulleys included with the 4D Stage. This was done 
because a slip between the belt
and pulleys was identified causing inaccuracies when rotating the sample. 
I don't know if someone else had this issue, 

*The redesign of the sample chamber so that the temperature of the medium 
can be controlled. For doing that a 
PT100 special for liquids, TO220 resistors and a PID controller were 
employed. The sample chamber had to
be built out of stainless steel so that  corrosive effects due to the 
sample medium can be avoided.

I can provide you the drawings and the CAD files, also the part number and 
manufacturer of the components that
were used,  just let me organize the information accordingly.

I think that would make sense to make this information available through 
the OpenSPIM wiki so that eveyone can use it if interested. 
At the same time I could have a feedback about the changes I made and 
further improvements can be done to the design. What is 
the opinion of all?

Best regards,
Edgar

I haven't noticed any trouble with belt slippage, but it's good to know 
this may be a problem (and moreover that there is an excellent solution 
available.)

This is great stuff. Do you know off-hand if these devices are stable 
over time? i.e. four hours, eight, twenty-four? I suspect good 
temperature control may improve time-lapse recording somewhat...

By all means! That's what the wiki is there for, after all.

Message-ID: <20140131022421.5wu62ak3kw0sw408@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hi everyone,

I am currently trying to compile OpenSPIM on a 64 bit machine running  
Windows 7. While I was able to get it to compile by modifying some of  
the build scripts; upon trying to open it from Fiji, I get the  
following error

Error: Failed to open libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilib
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V

Anyone has any idea where the above error could be originating from?

I would like to mention a couple of things that I did in case they  
could be relevant to the above error
1) I combined the compiled files with a manually downloaded 64-bit Fiji.
2) I had to add a reference to commons-math3-3.2.jar in many ant  
buildfiles in order to get it to compile.

Thanks,
Nikul

Hi Kevin,

Is great to know that the modifications I made will be helpful not only to me. I already talk to Jean Depaties from Picard Industries adressing the problem I experienced with the rotational movement.
He offered me to solve the issue (image attached), but of course would imply more costs and time, so I decided to find a way to use a timing belt or a chain to tramsmit the rotational movement. 
I already tested the rotational movement and works pretty fine.

I will let know Jean Depatie about my modification, and that it worked pretty good. Maybe he agree to change the sample arm for the new systems that Picard Industries ship.

Attached to this mail is a zip file containing some description of my modifications (sample arm and SPIM chamber) and all the information necessary to reproduce them.

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hi Luke,

I have not tested yet the temperature-controlled SPIM chamber for long periods of time, but of course, the idea of this modification is to improve the conditions of
the sample during long-term experiments.

Kind regards,
Edgar

 Hi Neil,

I attach to this mail a zip file containing all the information regarding the modifications I made to the OpenSPIM. If you have some questions
just let me know. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

Trying to have a look at the OpenSPIM application in action.  Downloaded the zip and updated as directed.  Ran the 32 bit version as well as 64 bit (which appeared after running the Fiji updater).  In both cases, starting Micro-Manager from the Fiji plugin menu throws an error stating that libMMCoreJ_wrap is not found.  

Any ideas how to run the software?

Thanks!

Nico

My guess is that the libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilib is compiled as a 32-bit
library. Possible?

Thanks for trying! Did you do that on a MacOSX computer? So far, we only
support 32-bit Windows, but 64-bit Windows is on the list...

The primary documentation how to build Micro-Manager on Windows is here:
http://micro-manager.org/wiki/Building_MM_on_Windows

I have not found any more information how to build 64-bit Micro-Manager,
but I have a strong feeling that inspecting the file Micro-Manager tries
to load (which should be listed in the log Micro-Manager writes). Either
it is the wrong architecture, or it is in the wrong place, that's my
guess.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

That's possible as all I did was to change the platform to x64 in the build script. Can you point me to which project does that library correspond to so I can investigate whether the correct flag is being passed while compiling it?

Thanks,

Hi Nikul,

--x64 is supposed to change "mm.architecture" to "x64" before calling Micro-Manager's build scripts; this should build MM in 64-bit. However, it's entirely probable that "build.sh" and/or "openspim.build.xml" do not copy the 64-bit files -- I would check first to see if the relevant binaries exist in "stage" or "build" subdirectories. If so, you'll have to look through the build system to see where we stage this files (I believe the relevant target is near the end of "openspim.build.xml") and make sure the correct architecture is copied from.


Hope this helps,
Luke

Hey Nico,

I haven't tested the set-up process on anything other than WinXP 32-bit. It sounds like Fiji (intelligently) attempted to replace the 32-bit version with a 64-bit version (as it's running in a 64-bit environment).


It might help to check the advanced updater panel, and look at "Only files from the 'OpenSPIM' update site", to make sure that MMCoreJ_wrap.dll is up-to-date.


Let me know if this helps,
Luke

I'll look into it and get back. If it works, it will be great to have some resource
on the OpenSPIM website for compiling it in 64-bit.
