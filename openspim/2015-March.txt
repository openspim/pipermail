Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM plugin does not allow to control laser
Message-ID: <CALKrRTGuUBTOvhVfbNS8QP9pEfB2pMUnJYb5dn2gVkZOsiRmdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am having an issue with the OpenSPIM plugin as it does not allow me to
control my coherent obis laser through this application. The app constantly
says my power is zero and whenever I try to change the setting it returns
to zero even when it is on!

I am just wondering whether there is a way that this can be fixed. I have
the correct settings specified on the micromanager page for the coherent
obis so I am wondering whether there maybe something I have missed.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Rob

Hey Rob,

Someone more knowledgeable feel free to correct me, but...

I believe the SPIMAcq won't work with any laser but those specifically
defined in the code (or with variables identical to those in
src/main/java/spim/setup/Laser.java).  So in order to get your laser
working in the plugin, I believe you'll have to download the source
for the SPIMAcq
plugin <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition>, make a java profile
similar to this
<https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/setup/Cobolt.java>
for your OBIS using variable names you can find here
<https://github.com/hadim/micromanager/blob/96f12e31227b2173b98093036c735a6f42b5516e/DeviceAdapters/CoherentOBIS/CoherentOBIS.cpp>,
place that new file in the appropriate folder (src/main/java/setup/) and
then compile it yourself (using maven).  Because it's still a Coherent
laser and they appear to use the same variable names to address the laser,
I think you can just copy the CoherentCube.java file, rename where you see
CoherentCube to OBIS, and rename the file to OBIS.java.

To compile, you'll need Maven which you can get here
<http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi> (need to setup a number of user
variables to get it to run, see installation instructions).  once maven is
installed, copy the SPIMAcq source from the git repository into
Fiji.app/plugins/Micro-Manager and run the following commands (in cmd.exe)
from that directory to compile.

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager
-Dversion=1.4.20-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMJ_ -Dfile=MMJ_.jar

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager
-Dversion=1.4.20-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMCoreJ
-Dfile=MMCoreJ.jar

mvn -Dscijava.enforce.skip


This should create a SPIMAcq that now supports your laser that you can copy
into the appropriate folder in Fiji.


Hope this helps,


Graham

Jon,

Thanks for your input.  For now I am trying to implement multichannel acquisition with the approach that the OpenSPIM plugin takes.  From what I've gathered the approach is not through the MDA but through direct manipulation of device properties-historically because of support for the theta axis?  Disclaimer: I'm not an expert of either.  In any event, one of the goals that has been discussed on the list is getting the OpenSPIM plugin more in-step with ongoing releases of micromanager and perhaps use of MDA might be an avenue to explore.  But, again this is beyond my experience with the plugin thus far(and its design) and better left to a discussion with Johannes.

Since last week, I am able to capture with specific filterwheel and DAC settings with the OpenSPIM plugin.  The gui I've implemented thus far is simple and built around the SteppedSlider class Johannes included with the OpenSPIM plugin-I'll take a look at your suggestions for inspiration.   There are some outstanding things (of course) including, getting micromanager to use blanking of the DACs as a shutter-not difficult, but critical, z bidirectionality and some image handling details(dealing with the multiple channels correctly, which you mention).

Once the dust settles I figure out how to push some of this back to micromanager, especially the DAC controller(hardware and software) which can be implemented for around $100 (custom shield, Arduino and the open micromanager device adapter I've modified).  Significantly cheaper than any of the other options out there.  In any event... I've rambled a bit.

Thanks again for your input!

Cheers,

Seth

Hi Seth,

I'm no expert in the OpenSPIM code, but I am very familiar with the diSPIM plugin in Micro-Manager which does something very similar.

If I understand the question correctly, you want to know how to tell Micro-Manager which images are from which channels so they will get saved correctly in a multi-dimensional dataset.  Make sure you add the metadata tag "ChannelIndex" to the TaggedImage you are presumably getting from the camera's circular buffer and then passing along to the Micro-Manager internals.  You'll also want to call setChannelName() so that the index is linked to a meaningful name.  See code at https://valelab.ucsf.edu/trac/micromanager/browser/plugins/ASIdiSPIM/src/org/micromanager/asidispim/AcquisitionPanel.java, look at runAcquisitionPrivate() (line 1506) which sets up the acquisition and then calls addImageToAcquisition() (line 2210) which adds the correct metadata and inserts the images into the ImageCache queue.  See also https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Multi-Dimensional_Acquisition_Programming.

If you are interested in the GUI aspects, see Micro-Manager's MDA window or the diSPIM plugin's simplified channel selection table.

Good luck!

Jon

Jon,

Right, you?re not using the MDA in the diSPIM plugin.  I am confusing the parts of MM, MDA vs what is accessible on the main window via the ScriptInterface-I have to put MDA out of my head.  You are using components that the MDA uses but not 'using' the MDA.   I do like the use of the ScriptInterface to implement multiple channels.  Was this to simplify the users experience or to compartmentalize the microscope state using the existing classes?  In any event, I can see the advantage of this approach, why not use the MM acquisition/configuration states.  Then I could take advantage of their functionality.

I?ll think on it.

Thanks again for your input it has been very helpful.

Hi Seth,

To clarify, the diSPIM plugin does not use the MDA either.  Instead it provides a separate GUI for performing acquisitions and Java code to handle the low-level details.

I know that in version 2.0 (still pre-beta I think) the Micro-Manager developers are trying to make it easier to "design your own acquisition", which should simplify things for people like doing acquisitions that don't fit into the MDA paradigm.

Hey Gabriel,

I?ve never experienced this limitation, but then again we only image fruitfly embryos so we never have to go that deep.

Are you one of the new HiRes 4D stage owners?

However, the hardware configuration ?described in this tutorial processing is two processors(Two Intel Xeon Processor E5-2630 (Six Core, 2.30GHz Turbo, 15MB, 7.2 GT/s) ?)
Dose recommend configuration? mean 4 processors or a process with 4 cores? I don't know which kinds of PCs should I buy. Can everyone give me your PC ?configuration? ?

Dear Zheng,

Its simple. For processing of light sheet data, OpenSPIM or not, buy as big a computer as you can afford. Have a look at this paper, Figure 3.

All the best

Dear PAvel,
Thanks for your reply. I was just reading this paper when received your reply. Now I have seen this part of the paper, and I'll talk about this with my boss.
Thank you again!

Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM plugin not opening
Message-ID: <CALKrRTGDzdW1A62O98=zXUmRDS8iML31tsq6gU8ZHYkUuM8u9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As you maybe aware from the OpenSPIM digest vol23, issue 2 I have been
trying to get my Coherent OBIS to work with your plugin on Micro-Manager.

I have had a lot of assistance already from Graham Marquart- which I
greatly appreciate- taking the download of the SPIM acquisition plugin to
constructing the required plugin using Maven. I alter your CoherentCube
java file to that which has Coherent Obis instead. Then Create the
executable files using maven with each install resulting in a build
success.

I copy the resulting plugin from the new target folder to the mmplugins
folder and subsequently run Fiji with MM- the developmental version which
installed with the latest version of Fiji. I tried to run the app but the
app does not open. It fails.

I have attached the error report generated by Micro-Manager to see where my
error might be? I have also attached the compile Graham had wrote for me
which has done an excellent job.

I apologise for having to bring this issue up again but I am not the
greatest when it comes to coding.

Thanks

Rob

  Hi Rob,


we?re hopefully getting an Obis tomorrow - I?ll try to get it running asap and then let you know what steps you have to take :-)


cheers,

  I actually remember a similar error we had when we used Coherent?s Sapphire lasers ? let?s see that can be confirmed tomorrow. If yes, it should be relatively easy to fix?

  Hello Rob,


it is indeed a rather obscure problem with different laser drivers in MM reporting their power in different units.?


The good news is, we got the Obis working :-) The fix will hopefully come to the main SPIMacquisition repository tomorrow after some more testing.


If you absolutely need it right now, you can get my testing version from?https://github.com/skalarproduktraum/SPIMAcquisition/archive/CoherentOBISSupport.zip - but your mileage may vary ;)
Then, follow the same steps as you did before for compiling it.


If you have any questions, let me know :)


cheers,


ulrik

Dear Zheng,

a CUDA-enabled graphics card will be beneficial for multi-view deconvolution:

http://openspim.org/Pre-requisites

A very capable card is the GeForce Titan (X). In my opinion, there is no need to invest in a Tesla or Quadro. Instead, go for more RAM and storage space!

Best,
Michael

Zheng,

Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia had they?re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn?t worth the extra cost either.

Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html).

Once you?ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github (https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases).

Happy crunching!

  Hello Rob,


the changes required for the Obis to work are now in the mainline code at?https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/ - so if you pull it and rebuild the plugin, you should be good to go!


We already ran two timelapse acquisitions with the Obis, no problems so far. Anyway, should you experience such, please let us know!


cheers!

Hi,Seth and Doug,?
    I searched the prices of the cards of Titan and Quadro, and found that the GeForce GTX Titan Black($1293) is more expensive than the Quadro K4000($977). Which kinds of Quadro does you use now, Seth?
   And just a few monthes ago, nVidia released the newest card of Titan X, but it does not acquire right now. And I also worry about the compatibility between sofeware and this newest kind of hardware.
    Can you send me the hardware configuration of your computer, Seth and Doug??
    Thank for replying me! All best!

Dear Opensim,

    Hi,

I am installing the OpenSPIM/Fiji package using windows XP 32-bit.

As you suggested, I downloaded the file ? OpenSPIM-20140207.zip?;

However, After unpacking it onto the Desktop, I can?t open
?ImageJ-win32.exe?, suggesting ?can?t find javaw.exe?.

 

Have you encountered this kind of problem? Any suggestions?

Thanks for your time. Looking forward to your reply.

 

BEST WISHES!

LIU Catherine

Hi Zheng,

but the Quadro K4000 is much less powerful: half the number of CUDA units, less RAM, less memory bandwidth. Even a higher-end Geforce GTX card would be better if you are looking for raw power. The Quadro has a couple of special chip-features activated, but that's only important if you use 3D-CAD software or anything like that.

Best,
Michael

Zheng,

Go with the Titan Black.  In terms of hardware, it is nearly the same thing as a K6000.  As has been mentioned, the K4000 is significantly less graphics card than the Titan and really only effective in a pair with a Tesla card for compute performance.  We are using K5200s mostly for support in our 840 HP towers, the price point and the possible upgrade path to a K5200 and Tesla combo.  All of these cards should be supported in the new dll I referenced earlier.

Cheers,

Seth

Hi,Seth and Doug,?
    I searched the prices of the cards of Titan and Quadro, and found that the GeForce GTX Titan Black($1293) is more expensive than the Quadro K4000($977). Which kinds of Quadro does you use now, Seth?
   And just a few monthes ago, nVidia released the newest card of Titan X, but it does not acquire right now. And I also worry about the compatibility between sofeware and this newest kind of hardware.
    Can you send me the hardware configuration of your computer, Seth and Doug??
    Thank for replying me! All best!

Zheng,

Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia had they?re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn?t worth the extra cost either.

Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html).

Once you?ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github (https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases).

Happy crunching!

Hi everyone:

I'm not sure this is the right place, but I figured it is relevant to
experimental design using the SPIM.

Is anyone aware of an updated ROSA26-Confetti (Brainbow 2.1) mouse? I know
Brainbow-3 (and sequential iterations) came out in 2013, so I'm curious if
that has been integrated with the ROSA locus yet.

Again, I apologize if this isn't the right forum for discussion.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <CALKrRTGuUBTOvhVfbNS8QP9pEfB2pMUnJYb5dn2gVkZOsiRmdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am having an issue with the OpenSPIM plugin as it does not allow me to
control my coherent obis laser through this application. The app constantly
says my power is zero and whenever I try to change the setting it returns
to zero even when it is on!

I am just wondering whether there is a way that this can be fixed. I have
the correct settings specified on the micromanager page for the coherent
obis so I am wondering whether there maybe something I have missed.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Hey Rob,

Someone more knowledgeable feel free to correct me, but...

I believe the SPIMAcq won't work with any laser but those specifically
defined in the code (or with variables identical to those in
src/main/java/spim/setup/Laser.java).  So in order to get your laser
working in the plugin, I believe you'll have to download the source
for the SPIMAcq
plugin <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition>, make a java profile
similar to this
<https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/setup/Cobolt.java>
for your OBIS using variable names you can find here
<https://github.com/hadim/micromanager/blob/96f12e31227b2173b98093036c735a6f42b5516e/DeviceAdapters/CoherentOBIS/CoherentOBIS.cpp>,
place that new file in the appropriate folder (src/main/java/setup/) and
then compile it yourself (using maven).  Because it's still a Coherent
laser and they appear to use the same variable names to address the laser,
I think you can just copy the CoherentCube.java file, rename where you see
CoherentCube to OBIS, and rename the file to OBIS.java.

To compile, you'll need Maven which you can get here
<http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi> (need to setup a number of user
variables to get it to run, see installation instructions).  once maven is
installed, copy the SPIMAcq source from the git repository into
Fiji.app/plugins/Micro-Manager and run the following commands (in cmd.exe)
from that directory to compile.

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager
-Dversion=1.4.20-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMJ_ -Dfile=MMJ_.jar

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.micromanager
-Dversion=1.4.20-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=MMCoreJ
-Dfile=MMCoreJ.jar

mvn -Dscijava.enforce.skip


This should create a SPIMAcq that now supports your laser that you can copy
into the appropriate folder in Fiji.


Hope this helps,


Graham

Jon,

Thanks for your input.  For now I am trying to implement multichannel acquisition with the approach that the OpenSPIM plugin takes.  From what I've gathered the approach is not through the MDA but through direct manipulation of device properties-historically because of support for the theta axis?  Disclaimer: I'm not an expert of either.  In any event, one of the goals that has been discussed on the list is getting the OpenSPIM plugin more in-step with ongoing releases of micromanager and perhaps use of MDA might be an avenue to explore.  But, again this is beyond my experience with the plugin thus far(and its design) and better left to a discussion with Johannes.

Since last week, I am able to capture with specific filterwheel and DAC settings with the OpenSPIM plugin.  The gui I've implemented thus far is simple and built around the SteppedSlider class Johannes included with the OpenSPIM plugin-I'll take a look at your suggestions for inspiration.   There are some outstanding things (of course) including, getting micromanager to use blanking of the DACs as a shutter-not difficult, but critical, z bidirectionality and some image handling details(dealing with the multiple channels correctly, which you mention).

Once the dust settles I figure out how to push some of this back to micromanager, especially the DAC controller(hardware and software) which can be implemented for around $100 (custom shield, Arduino and the open micromanager device adapter I've modified).  Significantly cheaper than any of the other options out there.  In any event... I've rambled a bit.

Thanks again for your input!

Cheers,

Seth

Subject: re: [OpenSPIM] MultiChannel Acquisition Implementation

Hi Seth,

I'm no expert in the OpenSPIM code, but I am very familiar with the diSPIM plugin in Micro-Manager which does something very similar.

If I understand the question correctly, you want to know how to tell Micro-Manager which images are from which channels so they will get saved correctly in a multi-dimensional dataset.  Make sure you add the metadata tag "ChannelIndex" to the TaggedImage you are presumably getting from the camera's circular buffer and then passing along to the Micro-Manager internals.  You'll also want to call setChannelName() so that the index is linked to a meaningful name.  See code at https://valelab.ucsf.edu/trac/micromanager/browser/plugins/ASIdiSPIM/src/org/micromanager/asidispim/AcquisitionPanel.java, look at runAcquisitionPrivate() (line 1506) which sets up the acquisition and then calls addImageToAcquisition() (line 2210) which adds the correct metadata and inserts the images into the ImageCache queue.  See also https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Multi-Dimensional_Acquisition_Programming.

If you are interested in the GUI aspects, see Micro-Manager's MDA window or the diSPIM plugin's simplified channel selection table.

Good luck!

Jon

Jon,

Right, you’re not using the MDA in the diSPIM plugin.  I am confusing the parts of MM, MDA vs what is accessible on the main window via the ScriptInterface-I have to put MDA out of my head.  You are using components that the MDA uses but not 'using' the MDA.   I do like the use of the ScriptInterface to implement multiple channels.  Was this to simplify the users experience or to compartmentalize the microscope state using the existing classes?  In any event, I can see the advantage of this approach, why not use the MM acquisition/configuration states.  Then I could take advantage of their functionality.

I’ll think on it.

Thanks again for your input it has been very helpful.

Hi Seth,

To clarify, the diSPIM plugin does not use the MDA either.  Instead it provides a separate GUI for performing acquisitions and Java code to handle the low-level details.

I know that in version 2.0 (still pre-beta I think) the Micro-Manager developers are trying to make it easier to "design your own acquisition", which should simplify things for people like doing acquisitions that don't fit into the MDA paradigm.

Hi All,

Is there any way of getting around the 250 slice limitation when using the "stack at this z-plus" function in the position list?

Thanks in advance,

Hey Gabriel,

I’ve never experienced this limitation, but then again we only image fruitfly embryos so we never have to go that deep.

Are you one of the new HiRes 4D stage owners?

Regards,
Pete

Subject: [OpenSPIM] About the data process PC hardware requirement
Message-ID: <tencent_68B2B6903038A152773A1B29@qq.com>

The recommend‍ configuration processing OpenSPIM data should have:
4 processors
48 GB of RAM
2TB of hard drive space
one CUDA capable graphics card‍



However, the hardware configuration ‍described in this tutorial processing is two processors(Two Intel Xeon Processor E5-2630 (Six Core, 2.30GHz Turbo, 15MB, 7.2 GT/s) ‍)
Dose recommend configuration‍ mean 4 processors or a process with 4 cores? I don't know which kinds of PCs should I buy. Can everyone give me your PC ‍configuration? ‍
Thank you very much!

Dear Zheng,

Its simple. For processing of light sheet data, OpenSPIM or not, buy as big a computer as you can afford. Have a look at this paper, Figure 3.

All the best

Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM plugin not opening
Message-ID: <CALKrRTGDzdW1A62O98=zXUmRDS8iML31tsq6gU8ZHYkUuM8u9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As you maybe aware from the OpenSPIM digest vol23, issue 2 I have been
trying to get my Coherent OBIS to work with your plugin on Micro-Manager.

I have had a lot of assistance already from Graham Marquart- which I
greatly appreciate- taking the download of the SPIM acquisition plugin to
constructing the required plugin using Maven. I alter your CoherentCube
java file to that which has Coherent Obis instead. Then Create the
executable files using maven with each install resulting in a build
success.

I copy the resulting plugin from the new target folder to the mmplugins
folder and subsequently run Fiji with MM- the developmental version which
installed with the latest version of Fiji. I tried to run the app but the
app does not open. It fails.

I have attached the error report generated by Micro-Manager to see where my
error might be? I have also attached the compile Graham had wrote for me
which has done an excellent job.

I apologise for having to bring this issue up again but I am not the
greatest when it comes to coding.

Thanks

Rob

  I actually remember a similar error we had when we used Coherent’s Sapphire lasers — let’s see that can be confirmed tomorrow. If yes, it should be relatively easy to fix…

  Hello Rob,


it is indeed a rather obscure problem with different laser drivers in MM reporting their power in different units. 


The good news is, we got the Obis working :-) The fix will hopefully come to the main SPIMacquisition repository tomorrow after some more testing.


If you absolutely need it right now, you can get my testing version from https://github.com/skalarproduktraum/SPIMAcquisition/archive/CoherentOBISSupport.zip - but your mileage may vary ;)
Then, follow the same steps as you did before for compiling it.


If you have any questions, let me know :)


cheers,


ulrik

Hi,everyone:
    Now I want to buy a computer to do the OpenSpim. Howeve, I don't know what kinds of graphics cards should I buy, Tesla or Quadro? I know Telsa is specific used for culculate and it is not support display, and quadro can be used for culculate and display.
Does the software of OpenSpim/fiji emphasize parallel culculate or render(display) ?
    Besides, I have no enough menoy to buy a computer equiped with both kinds of cards.

Dear Zheng,

a CUDA-enabled graphics card will be beneficial for multi-view deconvolution:

http://openspim.org/Pre-requisites

A very capable card is the GeForce Titan (X). In my opinion, there is no need to invest in a Tesla or Quadro. Instead, go for more RAM and storage space!

Best,
Michael

Zheng,

Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia had they’re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn’t worth the extra cost either.

Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html).

Once you’ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github (https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases).

Happy crunching!

Seth

Yes, we’re very happy with our GeForce GTX Titan Black.  We purchased it for ~$1000 through Newegg.com

  Hello Rob,


the changes required for the Obis to work are now in the mainline code at https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/ - so if you pull it and rebuild the plugin, you should be good to go!


We already ran two timelapse acquisitions with the Obis, no problems so far. Anyway, should you experience such, please let us know!


cheers!

Hi,Seth and Doug,‍
    I searched the prices of the cards of Titan and Quadro, and found that the GeForce GTX Titan Black($1293) is more expensive than the Quadro K4000($977). Which kinds of Quadro does you use now, Seth?
   And just a few monthes ago, nVidia released the newest card of Titan X, but it does not acquire right now. And I also worry about the compatibility between sofeware and this newest kind of hardware.
    Can you send me the hardware configuration of your computer, Seth and Doug‍?
    Thank for replying me! All best!

Zheng,
 
 
 
Look at Titan.  We went with Quadro, but it seems to me the Titan is just as capable for OpenSPIM deconvolution as implemented by Preibisch et al.  If nVidia  had they’re way they would have us buy a Tesla and a Quadro-a pretty penny indeed (http://www.nvidia.com/object/multi-gpu-technology.html).  In fact most of the Quadros are crippled to push  users to purchase the pair.  If I were going build another computer for OpenSPIM I would go with the Titan.  It is more than capable and arguably better than most of the Quadros by price and uses the same processor as the K6000.  There are differences in memory  architectures between the Titan and some (one) of the Quadro lines but this probably isn’t worth the extra cost either. 
 
 
 
Doug Richardson was using a Titan for OpenSPIM decon work.  From his posts on the list I understand it was a great purchase (http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/SPIM-multi-view-deconvolution-via-GPU-td5008097.html).
 
 
 
Once you’ve installed the computer be sure to use the updated dll.  Stephan Preibisch has posted an updated dll for the newer nVidia architectures on his github  (https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib/releases).
 
 
 
Happy crunching!

Hi,everyone:
 
  
    Now I want to buy a computer to do the OpenSpim. Howeve, I don't know what kinds of graphics cards should I buy, Tesla or Quadro? I know Telsa is specific used for culculate and it is not support display, and quadro can be used for  culculate and display.
 
  
Does the software of OpenSpim/fiji emphasize parallel culculate or render(display) ?
 
  
    Besides, I have no enough menoy to buy a computer equiped with both kinds of cards.

Dear Opensim,

    Hi,

I am installing the OpenSPIM/Fiji package using windows XP 32-bit.

As you suggested, I downloaded the file ‘ OpenSPIM-20140207.zip’;

However, After unpacking it onto the Desktop, I can’t open
‘ImageJ-win32.exe’, suggesting ‘can’t find javaw.exe’.

 

Have you encountered this kind of problem? Any suggestions?

Thanks for your time. Looking forward to your reply.

 

BEST WISHES!

LIU Catherine

Hi Zheng,

but the Quadro K4000 is much less powerful: half the number of CUDA units, less RAM, less memory bandwidth. Even a higher-end Geforce GTX card would be better if you are looking for raw power. The Quadro has a couple of special chip-features activated, but that's only important if you use 3D-CAD software or anything like that.

Best,
Michael

Zheng,

Go with the Titan Black.  In terms of hardware, it is nearly the same thing as a K6000.  As has been mentioned, the K4000 is significantly less graphics card than the Titan and really only effective in a pair with a Tesla card for compute performance.  We are using K5200s mostly for support in our 840 HP towers, the price point and the possible upgrade path to a K5200 and Tesla combo.  All of these cards should be supported in the new dll I referenced earlier.

Cheers,

Seth

Hi everyone:

I'm not sure this is the right place, but I figured it is relevant to
experimental design using the SPIM.

Is anyone aware of an updated ROSA26-Confetti (Brainbow 2.1) mouse? I know
Brainbow-3 (and sequential iterations) came out in 2013, so I'm curious if
that has been integrated with the ROSA locus yet.

Again, I apologize if this isn't the right forum for discussion.

Thank you,
