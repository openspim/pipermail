Hello Edgar,

Your solution of using the simpler cylindrical lens will work well if you don't use other laser
lines. Stay with the 50 mm focal length, as changing it will change the properties of the
light-sheet. I'm in the process of testing different lens combinations, and will update the wiki
accordingly as to what I find.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Edgar,

Remember, the cylindrical lens does not form the light sheet. The light sheet is generated by the (well-corrected) illumination objective lens so that, in the case of multi-color excitation, you will not get any focal shift.

Instead, the cylindrical lens just "prevents" the objective lens from focusing the light also in the vertical dimension. If now your cylindrical lens is not color-corrected, the beam coming out of the illumination lens is not perfectly collimated in the vertical dimension across all colors. In the worst case this would lead to a slightly inhomogeneous illumination. We have never had any problems with cylindrical singlet lenses, which are not color corrected. In fact, we use them on most of our setups.

Best
Jan

Thanks for the information. Would you mind adding it to the Wiki? I could
imagine that the FAQ ("Does it matter whether the cylindrical lens is
color-corrected?") would be a good place...

Thanks!

Hi Jan and Peter,

Thank you very much for the information. So, I will use the cylindrical singlet lens without color correction
since I will start using monochromatic illumination. I alredy saw that they are using this lens in the SPIM-DSLM
from the Open SPIN Microscopy google site.?

Kind regards,
Edgar

Hey Pete,

When you get a moment, could you write back with the typical settings you use for the laser power and camera exposure when acquiring? We acquired some data recently which I'm having some trouble registering; I think the signal is too weak, and I wanted to get an idea of what you guys have been using. Also anything else you think might be relevant to getting a good image, or tips for registering data, would be much appreciated!


Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

Do you mean the beads are too weak? Typically the beads are the brightest part of the image, unless you use ones that are incompatible with your illumination/emission spectrum. We use the OpenSPIM typically on very low laser power 2-4% and the exposure times are on the order of 50-100ms when imaging strong fluorescent signal. under these conditions the green beads are extremely bright in the green channel.

Can you send me some images? I may be able to help with the registration.

All the best

PAvel

Hi PAvel,

We used red beads for this most recent data set; I'm afraid I don't know further details beyond size (.2 um). Julie will know. We have some data in our BitTorrent Sync network which was taken with laser power 5mW (10% max) and exposure 250ms. Some other data from the same session was taken with laser power 10mW and exposure 100ms. (Unfortunately, since scratch is offline for the time being, short of BTS I'm not sure how to get it to you, but I can work on that and the bead details in a few hours.)

I *did* get a different set of our data to register this weekend, after some toying with the registration threshold. What value do you usually use with red beads? Same as with green, ~0.01?

Thanks!
Luke

Dear Kelvin,

Can I please trouble you about why the lenses configuration for the telescope in Open SPIM is a 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens? The part that confuse me is why expand by 2 times with beam expander and then shrink it 2 times with the telescope.

I had also attached two images of reflection of the light sheet from a mirror. In the first image, the lenses configuration for the telescope is 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens and FWHM = 12.1 pixels. In the second image, the lenses configuration for the telescope is changed to 25 mm focus lens followed by a 50 mm focus lens (opposite of Open SPIM) and FWHM = 7.7 pixels.

Does the lenses configuration with first a 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens generate a thicker light sheet?

Thank You,
John

Dear John,

This is from the original calculations. It has to do with filling the
back aperture of the cylindrical lens (at least in the axis of focus). We
are in the middle of testing new lens configurations, and will post our
findings on the wiki when we are finished.

I hope that my explanation helps rather than adds more confusion to the mix.

Best regards,
Pete

Hi PAvel and Pete (and all),

Johannes has mentioned that he prefers the speed of BitTorrent Sync to other methods (including Dropbox, FTP, and so forth). Since I'm inclined to agree with that decision, I've put one of our data sets in the BTS folder. If you follow the setup instructions from BitTorrent Labs and use the secret Johannes emailed to you a little while back (search your inbox for "BitTorrent"), you'll be able to download the files from our computer here. Please let me know what you think of the data.


In the new directory you made for BTS, once you're finished synchronizing (this could take some time), you'll see a directory called Madison-SPIM-Data. Immediately within is one of our data sets using red beads, laser power of 5 mW and exposure time of 250 ms. Also, inside the subdirectory '1', I've put the image I fused from a different data set (10 mW @ 100 ms -- I didn't have time to share that one yet; if you're hoping to reproduce the fusion, let me know and I'll get it shared). Interesting to note is that the bottom-left is surprisingly blurry; along with some evidence from a data acquisition done yesterday, it seems to suggest I may need to re-calibrate our system soon.


Thanks again,
Luke

Dear Pete,

Sorry, I may had phase the question wrongly. My question is why does the telescope shrink the beam before passing it to the 10x objective lens?

Best Regards,
John

Hi Luke,

I'd like to modify the code of the device adapter for our Cobolt laser to allow modulation of laser power from within OpenSPIM. As of now this is not working.

After looking at the CoherentCube source code, I am a bit confused as to which API(s) OpenSPIM or MicroManager are expecting.Could you point me in the right direction?

With my best regards,

Alexis

 Hi dear All,

I am having some issues about the RAM memory when I am trying to perform the Fusion of registered multiview
OpenSPIM data into a single output image using content based fusion.

I could perform the first step of the tutorial where the output image is downsampled 4 times, but when trying to
perform the no downsampled but cropped output image it was not possible because of lack of RAM memory.

I don't know what is the problem since the PC I am using has 24 GB RAM and only 695 MB RAM memory is needed
for the no downsampled but cropped output image. I have even set in the Memory & Thread option, the maximum
memory to 1599 MB, so it would be possible to perform the Fusion.

Anyway I am trying to increase the maximum memory but I can't set it more than 1600 MB because
a message appears and says: setting the memory limit to a value greater than 1600 MB on a 32-bit system may cause 
ImageJ to fail to start. The title of the Edit>Options>Memory & Threads dialog box changes to "Memory (64 bit)" when
ImageJ is running on a 64-bit version of Java.

The PC where Fiji is runnig is a 64 bit PC. I already installed the 64 bit version of Java, but nothing happens.

I would like to know what can I do to solve this issue I am having. 
Thank you in advance for your help and comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar Escobar Nieto

We also experienced those problems when working with a 32-bit Fiji. To
work around the limitations of 32-bit (where effectively only a fraction
of your RAM is accessible due to only 31 bit being available to address
it), we also installed a 64-bit Fiji from http://fiji.sc/ and ran the
fusion there. Maybe that works for you, too?

Ciao,
Johannes

The plan all along was to get things to a stage where we could contribute
our code to Micro-Manager itself. We have been not very good on that
front, I admit.

In the same spirit as wanting to contribute to Micro-Manager, however, I
have not the faintest problem with merging code into OpenSPIM's source
code that helps you run with a slightly different setup.

As I detailed this morning on the confocal mailing list, the meaning of
"Open" in "OpenSPIM" is intended to imply an inviting project, open to all
interested parties.

Therefore, I encourage you to contribute your patches; I am sure that we
can bring them into a form where the final product works for both Cobolt
and Cube lasers.

Ciao,
Johannes

We also experienced those problems when working with a 32-bit Fiji. To
work around the limitations of 32-bit (where effectively only a fraction
of your RAM is accessible due to only 31 bit being available to address
it), we also installed a 64-bit Fiji from http://fiji.sc/?and ran the
fusion there. Maybe that works for you, too?

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8aLk4W1wcLwiceR=UNU9CU-gQv_XR-BnFn3Key9PWFuWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Has anyone previously wanted to change the objective power in the open SPIM
system?  I was thinking of exchanging the 20x detection objective for a 40x
one from the same (Olympus) series, however there is a steric problem: the
working distance is slightly smaller and the objective slightly wider, so
it would make contact with the illumination objective.  Is it possible to
add or adjust some optics to move the light sheet or the focal plane in
order to accomodate this change?
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi Luke,

it fundamentally works. I modified the Cobolt device adapter code 	and I now can:
-  tweak the laser power from within the Properties Inspector. 
-  tweak the laser power using the Acquire SPIM image slider

For the later to work it took me a little while to realise that the property had to be called "PowerSetpoint" and not "PowerSetPoint" (note the minuscule P)?
The slider uses the "Minimum Laser Power" and "Maximum Laser Power" values as limits, but only allows quantum steps of 10mW. Is there a way to tweak this and allow a 1mW precision? 

With my best regards,

Alexis

I wonder whether it would not make a lot of sense to unify the laser
device adapters to agree on the same mechanism to set the laser power,
whether that be a property or a to-be-introduced API method.

In the short run, I would actually favor a solution where the SPIM plugin
detects that the laser is a Cobolt and uses the appropriate property name
of an unmodified Cobolt device adapter.

Maybe we should enhance the sliders so that a double-click lets you set
the value? Or even better, have a text box at the side which lets you
enter an exact value?

We never had the source code for that DLL. We briefly had the idea we
might help with porting it to Linux but due to the camera we use being
bound to Windows, we gave up on that idea.

Hello Luke,

You are free to use any of the software that you can download from the
website.
The only software that is proprietary (not to be given or made available) is
the source code for our DLL (PiUsb.dll).
This DLL contains the intellectual property that we developed for using the
USB port to control our devices.
I do not believe we gave you this source code, but if we did, please do not
let anyone have it.
Otherwise, everything else is available, example code and all.
Is this acceptable?
Thanks

Hi Alexis,

The problem would be, I guess, differing power scales -- where the Cube's property is in mW (so the step is 10uW), the Cobolt's is in W. If you still don't want to alter SPIMAcquisition, you'll have to divide by 1000 when setting and multiply by the same when getting; see the OnPower member function.

Let me know how it works out; this will be useful when I centralize the laser control.

This is precisely what I intend to do. Basically, I expect we'll need some associative map of device adapter names (i.e. "PicardStage" or "Cobolt") to the correct property name, minimum and maximum (be they properties or constant values), and a multiplier (to settle the issue below).

We do have a text box, ala the motors tab; unfortunately, the two device adapters (or more precisely, the two devices) operate on different power scales: where the Cube is on mW, the Cobolt is on W. Any unified laser control will need to take different scales into account (since this is, most unfortunately, a property of the laser's control module, and not our code).

Is it possible to get the solidworks file of the assembly (such as the one animated on the website) in a pack and go format? 

This would make it much easier to investigate possible modifications.

Message-ID: <3FEEC96F-6E46-4B4F-8A50-141F6E9E169E@cos.uni-heidelberg.de>

Hi, 

I noticed that upon acquisition of a stack  written to disk, OpenSPIM occasionally pauses in the middle of the acquisition for  some seconds to several minutes. I have only observed this when the stack is written to disk, not when the same stack is left in RAM and opened immediately. I tried to turn ON/OFF the asynchronous writing option but that did not change anything. 
The stacks in question were 2048*2048*101 at 16bit on a 32bit Fiji (1024Meg of RAM allocated to Fiji) running on Windows 7 Pro. 
Also I have noticed that I can not increase the memory allocated to Fiji beyond 1024M as it causes the HamamatsuHam driver to not load properly. 

With my best regards,

Alexis

I do not think that Pete (Cc:ed to get his attention) uploaded a complete
assembly as .STL:

http://openspim.org/index.php?limit=50&ilsearch=.stl&user=&title=Special%3AListFiles

You can see all the parts, though.

Pete, would you be willing to upload a .STL file of the complete OpenSPIM

Are you running an anti-virus software that could be at fault?

Yes, that is unfortunately not something we can fix until we switch to a
64-bit version (which should be doable soon, given the hardware).

I've been getting some weird hangings as each slice is written out (affecting the entire operating system, not just the SPIM software), but typically they were lasting no more than a half-second, and never on the order of minutes. They're recent, and I've been doing some timing tests to try and determine the cause to greater accuracy than 'when writing'.


I take it the disk is local to the computer?

 Hi dear all,

I reached to the point where I need to calibrate the light-sheet. And I was wondering
what is the optical density of the ND filter recommended to perform the calibration.

I would like to know also what is the Frequency (lp/mm) recommended for the Opal Glass Ronchi Ruling Slides.
I think that high a frequency would be better, but there must be a limit.

Only to be sure, what I understood is that these Ruling Slides have already a reflective surface, so there is no
need to glue a mirror to the ruling slides.

Thank you in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar Escobar Nieto

Not that I am aware of, but there might be a lot of crap (updates, power manager, blabla?) that could interfere. I will see at cleaning this mess a bit.
However, I did not notice anything happening @ the GUI level and correlating with these hangs.

Hello Edgar,

Your solution of using the simpler cylindrical lens will work well if you don't use other laser
lines. Stay with the 50 mm focal length, as changing it will change the properties of the
light-sheet. I'm in the process of testing different lens combinations, and will update the wiki
accordingly as to what I find.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hi Edgar,

Remember, the cylindrical lens does not form the light sheet. The light sheet is generated by the (well-corrected) illumination objective lens so that, in the case of multi-color excitation, you will not get any focal shift.

Instead, the cylindrical lens just "prevents" the objective lens from focusing the light also in the vertical dimension. If now your cylindrical lens is not color-corrected, the beam coming out of the illumination lens is not perfectly collimated in the vertical dimension across all colors. In the worst case this would lead to a slightly inhomogeneous illumination. We have never had any problems with cylindrical singlet lenses, which are not color corrected. In fact, we use them on most of our setups.

Thanks for the information. Would you mind adding it to the Wiki? I could
imagine that the FAQ ("Does it matter whether the cylindrical lens is
color-corrected?") would be a good place...

Thanks!

Hi Jan and Peter,

Thank you very much for the information. So, I will use the cylindrical singlet lens without color correction
since I will start using monochromatic illumination. I alredy saw that they are using this lens in the SPIM-DSLM
from the Open SPIN Microscopy google site. 

Kind regards,
Edgar

Betreff: Re: [OpenSPIM] About the cylindrical lens

Hi Edgar,

Remember, the cylindrical lens does not form the light sheet. The light sheet is generated by the (well-corrected) illumination objective lens so that, in the case of multi-color excitation, you will not get any focal shift.

Instead, the cylindrical lens just "prevents" the objective lens from focusing the light also in the vertical dimension. If now your cylindrical lens is not color-corrected, the beam coming out of the illumination lens is not perfectly collimated in the vertical dimension across all colors. In the worst case this would lead to a slightly inhomogeneous illumination. We have never had any problems with cylindrical singlet lenses, which are not color corrected. In fact, we use them on most of our setups.

Hello Edgar,

Your solution of using the simpler cylindrical lens will work well if you don't use other laser
lines. Stay with the 50 mm focal length, as changing it will change the properties of the
light-sheet. I'm in the process of testing different lens combinations, and will update the wiki
accordingly as to what I find.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hey Pete,

When you get a moment, could you write back with the typical settings you use for the laser power and camera exposure when acquiring? We acquired some data recently which I'm having some trouble registering; I think the signal is too weak, and I wanted to get an idea of what you guys have been using. Also anything else you think might be relevant to getting a good image, or tips for registering data, would be much appreciated!


Thanks,

Hi Luke,

Do you mean the beads are too weak? Typically the beads are the brightest part of the image, unless you use ones that are incompatible with your illumination/emission spectrum. We use the OpenSPIM typically on very low laser power 2-4% and the exposure times are on the order of 50-100ms when imaging strong fluorescent signal. under these conditions the green beads are extremely bright in the green channel.

Can you send me some images? I may be able to help with the registration.

All the best

PAvel

Hi PAvel,

We used red beads for this most recent data set; I'm afraid I don't know further details beyond size (.2 um). Julie will know. We have some data in our BitTorrent Sync network which was taken with laser power 5mW (10% max) and exposure 250ms. Some other data from the same session was taken with laser power 10mW and exposure 100ms. (Unfortunately, since scratch is offline for the time being, short of BTS I'm not sure how to get it to you, but I can work on that and the bead details in a few hours.)

I *did* get a different set of our data to register this weekend, after some toying with the registration threshold. What value do you usually use with red beads? Same as with green, ~0.01?

Thanks!
Luke

Message-ID: <E55B3C5CC061114E817EBD3B94D0B0B303DFC84E5F99@BMSIMBOX4.bmsi.a-star.edu.sg>

Dear Kelvin,

Can I please trouble you about why the lenses configuration for the telescope in Open SPIM is a 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens? The part that confuse me is why expand by 2 times with beam expander and then shrink it 2 times with the telescope.

I had also attached two images of reflection of the light sheet from a mirror. In the first image, the lenses configuration for the telescope is 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens and FWHM = 12.1 pixels. In the second image, the lenses configuration for the telescope is changed to 25 mm focus lens followed by a 50 mm focus lens (opposite of Open SPIM) and FWHM = 7.7 pixels.

Does the lenses configuration with first a 50 mm focus lens followed by a 25 mm focus lens generate a thicker light sheet?

Thank You,
John

Dear John,

This is from the original calculations. It has to do with filling the
back aperture of the cylindrical lens (at least in the axis of focus). We
are in the middle of testing new lens configurations, and will post our
findings on the wiki when we are finished.

I hope that my explanation helps rather than adds more confusion to the mix.

Best regards,
Pete

Hi PAvel and Pete (and all),

Johannes has mentioned that he prefers the speed of BitTorrent Sync to other methods (including Dropbox, FTP, and so forth). Since I'm inclined to agree with that decision, I've put one of our data sets in the BTS folder. If you follow the setup instructions from BitTorrent Labs and use the secret Johannes emailed to you a little while back (search your inbox for "BitTorrent"), you'll be able to download the files from our computer here. Please let me know what you think of the data.


In the new directory you made for BTS, once you're finished synchronizing (this could take some time), you'll see a directory called Madison-SPIM-Data. Immediately within is one of our data sets using red beads, laser power of 5 mW and exposure time of 250 ms. Also, inside the subdirectory '1', I've put the image I fused from a different data set (10 mW @ 100 ms -- I didn't have time to share that one yet; if you're hoping to reproduce the fusion, let me know and I'll get it shared). Interesting to note is that the bottom-left is surprisingly blurry; along with some evidence from a data acquisition done yesterday, it seems to suggest I may need to re-calibrate our system soon.


Thanks again,
Luke

Dear Pete,

Sorry, I may had phase the question wrongly. My question is why does the telescope shrink the beam before passing it to the 10x objective lens?

Best Regards,
John

Subject: Re: Lenses Configuration for Telescope in Open SPIM

Dear John,

This is from the original calculations. It has to do with filling the
back aperture of the cylindrical lens (at least in the axis of focus). We
are in the middle of testing new lens configurations, and will post our
findings on the wiki when we are finished.

I hope that my explanation helps rather than adds more confusion to the mix.

Best regards,
Pete

Hi Luke,

I'd like to modify the code of the device adapter for our Cobolt laser to allow modulation of laser power from within OpenSPIM. As of now this is not working.

After looking at the CoherentCube source code, I am a bit confused as to which API(s) OpenSPIM or MicroManager are expecting.Could you point me in the right direction?

With my best regards,

Alexis

I have added to the Wiki our device to the list (http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F).
In the coming days I will update the page about its specifications that slightly differ from the  original ones.

 Hi dear All,

I am having some issues about the RAM memory when I am trying to perform the Fusion of registered multiview
OpenSPIM data into a single output image using content based fusion.

I could perform the first step of the tutorial where the output image is downsampled 4 times, but when trying to
perform the no downsampled but cropped output image it was not possible because of lack of RAM memory.

I don't know what is the problem since the PC I am using has 24 GB RAM and only 695 MB RAM memory is needed
for the no downsampled but cropped output image. I have even set in the Memory & Thread option, the maximum
memory to 1599 MB, so it would be possible to perform the Fusion.

Anyway I am trying to increase the maximum memory but I can't set it more than 1600 MB because
a message appears and says: setting the memory limit to a value greater than 1600 MB on a 32-bit system may cause 
ImageJ to fail to start. The title of the Edit>Options>Memory & Threads dialog box changes to "Memory (64 bit)" when
ImageJ is running on a 64-bit version of Java.

The PC where Fiji is runnig is a 64 bit PC. I already installed the 64 bit version of Java, but nothing happens.

I would like to know what can I do to solve this issue I am having. 
Thank you in advance for your help and comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar Escobar Nieto

We also experienced those problems when working with a 32-bit Fiji. To
work around the limitations of 32-bit (where effectively only a fraction
of your RAM is accessible due to only 31 bit being available to address
it), we also installed a 64-bit Fiji from http://fiji.sc/ and ran the
fusion there. Maybe that works for you, too?

Ciao,
Johannes

The plan all along was to get things to a stage where we could contribute
our code to Micro-Manager itself. We have been not very good on that
front, I admit.

In the same spirit as wanting to contribute to Micro-Manager, however, I
have not the faintest problem with merging code into OpenSPIM's source
code that helps you run with a slightly different setup.

As I detailed this morning on the confocal mailing list, the meaning of
"Open" in "OpenSPIM" is intended to imply an inviting project, open to all
interested parties.

Therefore, I encourage you to contribute your patches; I am sure that we
can bring them into a form where the final product works for both Cobolt
and Cube lasers.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Jean,

We're getting to the point where we're ready to submit the device adapter we've been writing to be included in Micro-Manager, and so I'm writing this email to make sure it's alright that we include the PicardStage SDK (the DLLs, libraries, and header files) in Micro-Manger's "3rdpartypublic". For reference, the files we'd like to include, along with the PicardStage device adapter code we wrote, are no more than what is available for download through your website.


If you have any objection, please do let us know!


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Message-ID: <CAHAw+8aLk4W1wcLwiceR=UNU9CU-gQv_XR-BnFn3Key9PWFuWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Has anyone previously wanted to change the objective power in the open SPIM
system?  I was thinking of exchanging the 20x detection objective for a 40x
one from the same (Olympus) series, however there is a steric problem: the
working distance is slightly smaller and the objective slightly wider, so
it would make contact with the illumination objective.  Is it possible to
add or adjust some optics to move the light sheet or the focal plane in
order to accomodate this change?
Thanks,
Aurelia

Hi Luke,

it fundamentally works. I modified the Cobolt device adapter code 	and I now can:
-  tweak the laser power from within the Properties Inspector. 
-  tweak the laser power using the Acquire SPIM image slider

For the later to work it took me a little while to realise that the property had to be called "PowerSetpoint" and not "PowerSetPoint" (note the minuscule P)…
The slider uses the "Minimum Laser Power" and "Maximum Laser Power" values as limits, but only allows quantum steps of 10mW. Is there a way to tweak this and allow a 1mW precision? 

With my best regards,

Alexis

I wonder whether it would not make a lot of sense to unify the laser
device adapters to agree on the same mechanism to set the laser power,
whether that be a property or a to-be-introduced API method.

In the short run, I would actually favor a solution where the SPIM plugin
detects that the laser is a Cobolt and uses the appropriate property name
of an unmodified Cobolt device adapter.

Maybe we should enhance the sliders so that a double-click lets you set
the value? Or even better, have a text box at the side which lets you
enter an exact value?

We never had the source code for that DLL. We briefly had the idea we
might help with porting it to Linux but due to the camera we use being
bound to Windows, we gave up on that idea.

Hello Luke,

You are free to use any of the software that you can download from the
website.
The only software that is proprietary (not to be given or made available) is
the source code for our DLL (PiUsb.dll).
This DLL contains the intellectual property that we developed for using the
USB port to control our devices.
I do not believe we gave you this source code, but if we did, please do not
let anyone have it.
Otherwise, everything else is available, example code and all.
Is this acceptable?
Thanks

Subject: Including OpenSPIM's PicardStage device adapter in Micro-Manager

Hi Jean,

We're getting to the point where we're ready to submit the device adapter
we've been writing to be included in Micro-Manager, and so I'm writing this
email to make sure it's alright that we include the PicardStage SDK (the
DLLs, libraries, and header files) in Micro-Manger's "3rdpartypublic". For
reference, the files we'd like to include, along with the PicardStage device
adapter code we wrote, are no more than what is available for download
through your website.


If you have any objection, please do let us know!


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg

Hi Alexis,

The problem would be, I guess, differing power scales -- where the Cube's property is in mW (so the step is 10uW), the Cobolt's is in W. If you still don't want to alter SPIMAcquisition, you'll have to divide by 1000 when setting and multiply by the same when getting; see the OnPower member function.

Let me know how it works out; this will be useful when I centralize the laser control.

This is precisely what I intend to do. Basically, I expect we'll need some associative map of device adapter names (i.e. "PicardStage" or "Cobolt") to the correct property name, minimum and maximum (be they properties or constant values), and a multiplier (to settle the issue below).

We do have a text box, ala the motors tab; unfortunately, the two device adapters (or more precisely, the two devices) operate on different power scales: where the Cube is on mW, the Cobolt is on W. Any unified laser control will need to take different scales into account (since this is, most unfortunately, a property of the laser's control module, and not our code).

Is it possible to get the solidworks file of the assembly (such as the one animated on the website) in a pack and go format? 

This would make it much easier to investigate possible modifications.

Thanks for the great work.

Message-ID: <3FEEC96F-6E46-4B4F-8A50-141F6E9E169E@cos.uni-heidelberg.de>

Hi, 

I noticed that upon acquisition of a stack  written to disk, OpenSPIM occasionally pauses in the middle of the acquisition for  some seconds to several minutes. I have only observed this when the stack is written to disk, not when the same stack is left in RAM and opened immediately. I tried to turn ON/OFF the asynchronous writing option but that did not change anything. 
The stacks in question were 2048*2048*101 at 16bit on a 32bit Fiji (1024Meg of RAM allocated to Fiji) running on Windows 7 Pro. 
Also I have noticed that I can not increase the memory allocated to Fiji beyond 1024M as it causes the HamamatsuHam driver to not load properly. 

With my best regards,

Alexis

I do not think that Pete (Cc:ed to get his attention) uploaded a complete
assembly as .STL:

http://openspim.org/index.php?limit=50&ilsearch=.stl&user=&title=Special%3AListFiles

You can see all the parts, though.

Pete, would you be willing to upload a .STL file of the complete OpenSPIM
"1.0" setup?

Ciao,
Johannes

Are you running an anti-virus software that could be at fault?

Yes, that is unfortunately not something we can fix until we switch to a
64-bit version (which should be doable soon, given the hardware).

I have only observed this when the stack is written to disk, not when the same stack is left in RAM and opened immediately. I tried to turn ON/OFF the asynchronous writing option but that did not change anything. 

I've been getting some weird hangings as each slice is written out (affecting the entire operating system, not just the SPIM software), but typically they were lasting no more than a half-second, and never on the order of minutes. They're recent, and I've been doing some timing tests to try and determine the cause to greater accuracy than 'when writing'.


I take it the disk is local to the computer?

Yes, I would...

When I return from my vacation in the states in mid August I will send a
Solidworks P&G to Rob, and upload a STL file to the wiki.

 Hi dear all,

I reached to the point where I need to calibrate the light-sheet. And I was wondering
what is the optical density of the ND filter recommended to perform the calibration.

I would like to know also what is the Frequency (lp/mm) recommended for the Opal Glass Ronchi Ruling Slides.
I think that high a frequency would be better, but there must be a limit.

Only to be sure, what I understood is that these Ruling Slides have already a reflective surface, so there is no
need to glue a mirror to the ruling slides.

Thank you in advance for your comments.

Kind regards,
Edgar Escobar Nieto

Not that I am aware of, but there might be a lot of crap (updates, power manager, blabla…) that could interfere. I will see at cleaning this mess a bit.
However, I did not notice anything happening @ the GUI level and correlating with these hangs.

Yep, internal HD.

Let's wait then.
