Subject: [OpenSPIM] Linux Support for The Imaging Source Cameras (Open
	Source) (fwd)
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.1404031706390.14982@s15462909.onlinehome-server.info>

Hi all,

in the OpenSPIM project, we tried TheImagingSource cameras first (we had
some heat-related problems which I *suspected* to be caused by the
Firewire-to-USB adapter embedded into the camera). My overall impression
was very good, though: the cameras are affordable and produce a decent
image quality, so I would like to bring the announcement below to your
attention.

Ciao,
Johannes

Hi Cristian,

Well, somewhere, Alexis is shaking his head. ;-) He did, after all, warn us about this...


Please try the following:
1. Check that the file "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" exists (it probably does).
2. Send a new CoreLog (from a day when this error was encountered) to me.
3. Download a new, 32-bit version of Micro-Manager from the website[1] and install it.
4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).
5. Try launching the software again. If it still fails, send me yet another CoreLog.


Thanks again, and I'm sorry for the trouble!
Luke


P.S. Please use reply-all, to keep the mailing list CC'd. :-)

The file seems to indicate that a necessary JAR file is missing for OME-TIFF output -- the most likely candidate is OpenSPIM.app/jars/bio-formats/formats-api-5.0.0.jar (the latest version available through the Fiji Updater).

Our plugin does not currently come with Micro-Manager, so if you download Micro-Manager's latest version from their website, you won't be able to control an OpenSPIM. The Fiji updater, on the other hand, downloads newer versions of the files OpenSPIM relies on.

Hi Alexis,

Unfortunately, we've begun working to submit the PicardStage device adapter to Micro-Manager, which is going to take up a significant amount of my time for the next few days...?

Hopefully this will be the case! There have been a few other changes to the code, but ideally, it will work as described. However, the true utility of the update is that it can, with a few changes to some Java code, control almost any device.


The Cobolt device adapter, in particular, should already be working. I haven't yet been able to test this, of course, but in working with Cristian to get their setup working, hopefully any major issues will present themselves.


The main problem I'm aware of presently is that the Cobolt device adapter on the OpenSPIM update site (that is, the file obtained when running the Fiji updater) may be an outdated version. OpenSPIM should be able to support the latest DLL from Micro-Manager, however, so copying the file from a fresh MM install may be a temporary workaround until I get a moment to fix this.


Thanks again for your offer to help! The biggest issue is to test the paragraph above:
- Will a fresh install of OpenSPIM, fully updated, control a Cobolt laser without trouble?
- If the DLL won't load, will the current version from Micro-Manager load?
- Once a loading DLL is found (and, for my part, uploaded to the update site), will the plugin be able to control it seamlessly?


If you can find any answers to those questions, I'd greatly appreciate it!


Thanks,
Luke

Hi,

Dear Julien!

you should use a mirror mounted under 45?. This is described in detail in http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1533/pdf/huisken_phd.pdf, or e.g. in http://staff.science.nus.edu.sg/~chmwt/publications/Singh%20AP%202013%202D%20array_supplementary.pdf and http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/publications/files/spimfccs2013_supplement.pdf

Then you can do a Gaussian fit to cuts through the light sheet.

Best,
JAN

Hi Luke,

Well, somewhere, Alexis is shaking his head. ;-) He did, after all, warn us about this...
:D 

Please try the following:
1. Check that the file "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" exists (it probably does).
	Yes, the file exists
2. Send a new CoreLog (from a day when this error was encountered) to me.
	Sending the corelog: CoreLog20140402.txt
3. Download a new, 32-bit version of Micro-Manager from the website[1] and install it.
	Downloaded and installed the last version (32bit_1.4.16)
4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).
	I didn`t find the file in "Program Files x86" (althought we are using "Windows 7_64bit"), I copied the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\"
5. Try launching the software again. If it still fails, send me yet another CoreLog.
	I launched the "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app", loading the Configuration File "OpenSPIM01.app.cfg" and I had no problem recognized the devices, but now when I click "Plugins" in the MicroManager windows, don?t appear nothing! :O
I sending the second CoreLog for today (CoreLog20140407.txt).

Other data: 1) A message appeared to update Java for Windows, would be necessary?. 2) when I specified a new directory for ex. a "file 1" in the desktop, the pic was no taken or the time-lapse don`t start, but also, if I had some file inside the "file 1", these were deleted without any notice!.

Thanks to you for the help!, I guess the idea is that all we go to cooperate with the project.
:-)
Best,

Cristian


Thanks again, and I'm sorry for the trouble!

Odd. This core log, and the next one, suggest that the OpenSPIM plugin isn't up-to-date. Please check the following:

1. Run the software and click "Help -> Update Fiji"
2. If the software says, "Your ImageJ is up to date!", please let me know (but click "OK" and continue with these instructions).
3. Click "Advanced Mode" in the lower-right corner.
4. At the top of the window, change "View Options" to "View files of the 'OpenSPIM' site".
5. If anything in the list is not "Up-to-date", click on the status/action and set it to "Update it" or "Install it".
6. Click "Apply changes" to update all of OpenSPIM's files.
7. Restart the software, and see if the plugin shows up now.


If you're still having trouble after this, I'll want to explore the problem more directly. If the software still isn't working, please:
1. Click "Plugins -> Utilities -> Make Fiji Package".
2. For type, select "ZIP" and click "OK".
3. Save the package somewhere you'll remember. (The Desktop works.)
4. Let the plugin run until it tells you, "Wrote <file name>", then click "OK".
5. Click "Help -> Upload Sample Image".
6. Browse to where you saved the file, select it, and click "Open".
7. Wait for the upload to finish.


>> 4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).

> Other data: 1) A message appeared to update Java for Windows, would be necessary?.
It should not be, but I've just noticed that OpenSPIM may not have been packaged with Java. If you downloaded the software very recently (OpenSPIM-20140207.zip), it may be using your system Java instead of its own. 


> 2) when I specified a new directory for ex. a "file 1" in the desktop, the pic was no taken or the time-lapse don`t start, but also, if I had some file inside the "file 1", these were deleted without any notice!.
This behavior was certainly removed from recent versions of OpenSPIM. (To be precise, it was removed on 26 August 2013 -- the latest version of OpenSPIM is from 7 February 2014.) For some reason, it seems your update updated everything except OpenSPIM itself.


> Thanks to you for the help!, I guess the idea is that all we go to cooperate with the project.
Every little bit helps! You may not be the only person having trouble with our software, but only the first to contact us -- and so if we can fix this issue, it will benefit the project as a whole. :)



Once again, thanks for your cooperation.
Luke

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Slit aperture function
Message-ID: <CAADJ=-qXqcrGo+LSBwhGOOj_KZGBV9+wiHuYS91q_1F6+8E2ng@mail.gmail.com>

Dear SPIM folks,

i) A big Thank You to the many people involved in setting up this fantastic
source! It gave me a lot of confidence in building my own light sheet,
knowing there's a great reference like this - excellent instructions,
theoretical background, software and all - seriously genius!

ii) Apologies in advance, this might expand a bit - but I would like to get
some clarification on the slit, and its influence on the light sheet. So
the slit truncates the expanded Gaussian beam (1), already forming a light
sheet (2). The cylindrical lens then focusses this sheet in one dimension.
An a- or apochromatic objective lens can be used after that (3) for further
focussing. Alternatively, a cylindrical lens can be used on its own to
create a light sheet (4) (stop me if I'm off).
Now, the questions are these:
   a) A wide open slit shortens the Rayleigh range. But it also seems to
have less uniformity not only along the axis of propagation, but also
perpendicular to it (i.e. travelling along the waist), since the slit
aperture produces an 'Airy line' with higher order diffraction patterns
causing minima and maxima. Is there any description of this in the
literature?
   b) Conversely, if a thicker (= larger waist) light sheet with less
intensity is acceptable, the slit can be closed narrowly, and the central
zeroth order maximum expands. Is this, as appears to me, the most uniform
part of the light sheet? I couldn't find any information on the aperture of
the slit.
   c) There is a host of different formulae for calculating the theoretical
dimensions of a light sheet (e.g. 5,6). The openSPIM calculator widget of
Peter and Tobias mentions two slits, horizontal and vertical. Which formula
underpins this? And why two slits?

I currently don't use a slit for my meso-/macroscopic setup for corals, but
am intrigued by this (and discussed it with some SPIMmers here, without
really getting anywhere).

With many, many thanks

Philippe

Hi Luke!

The force is with us!! :D
After the update via "Advanced Mode", appeared two updates, one for the "Hamamatsu camera" and one for the "SPIMAcquisition", I apply the changes, restart the app and after that, the software is working wonderful!. I can save the experiment in another directory (always delete the data inside the selected file!, but now displays a warning), and hence, we can use the computer storage (300Gb).
I started a time-lapse and everything wasl ok, saved in the correct directory etc.
Thanks a lot for the help to everybody!, Jan-Felix, Alexis and Luke!, when I go to Germany, I`ll take a good chilean wine for each.
:-)
Best regards to all,

Cristian

The file seems to indicate that a necessary JAR file is missing for OME-TIFF output -- the most likely candidate is OpenSPIM.app/jars/bio-formats/formats-api-5.0.0.jar (the latest version available through the Fiji Updater).

Our plugin does not currently come with Micro-Manager, so if you download Micro-Manager's latest version from their website, you won't be able to control an OpenSPIM. The Fiji updater, on the other hand, downloads newer versions of the files OpenSPIM relies on.

Hi cristian,

I am happy to read that you were fearless and updated. 
Basically by simply swapping the cobolt device adapter currently shipping with MM in place  of the one bundled with OpenSpIm solves your issue and showed that it works out-of-the-box. 
This is great news as it means no modification of the driver required. 
Thanks again for your leap of faith. 
You are more adventurous than me. 

@luke: this basically answers many of the questions you had, no? 

Best,

Alexis

Dear OPEN-SPIM team,

your website is terrific!
Since a while we are now getting more and more interested in setting up our own SPIM for a multitude of potential applications.
My impression is, that for many purposes a dual color-X-SPIM would be needed.
You show nice pictures on your page of such a system (X-SPIM), but in the parts list the corresponding chamber is not listed.
Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under ?OPEN SPIM? at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

Thanks a lot in advance, looking forward to hearing from you!
Best regards, R?diger

Dear All,

I had measured the light sheet using 45 degree mirror last week and I had also did a Gaussian fit for it. I will happily share the data with everyone here. Attached are the max intensity projection along x-axis and the FWHM measurement. The max intensity projection shows the light sheet along different x-position as I move the mirror.

Best Regards,
John

Hi cristian,

I am happy to read that you were fearless and updated.
Basically by simply swapping the cobolt device adapter currently shipping with MM in place  of the one bundled with OpenSpIm solves your issue and showed that it works out-of-the-box.
This is great news as it means no modification of the driver required.
Thanks again for your leap of faith.
You are more adventurous than me.

@luke: this basically answers many of the questions you had, no?

Best,

Alexis

your website is terrific!
Since a while we are now getting more and more interested in setting up our own SPIM for a multitude of potential applications.
My impression is, that for many purposes a dual color-X-SPIM would be needed.
You show nice pictures on your page of such a system (X-SPIM), but in the parts list the corresponding chamber is not listed.
Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under ?OPEN SPIM? at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

Thanks a lot in advance, looking forward to hearing from you!
Best regards, R?diger

The picture of X-OpenSPIM is a model, it does not exist (at least not to my knowledge). One can in principle build such a microscope, but it will necessarily involve some technology development. 

> Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under ?OPEN SPIM? at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

We don't sell anything. The parts are obtainable from standard manufacturers as indicated. Custom parts need to be done either by your workshop according to the provided plans or you can click on the email icon next to the parts list and get them from Pieter Fourie in South Africa.

All the best

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Andor iXon3 camera
Message-ID: <5347F2C9.9040502@biomed.cas.cz>

Dear all,

I need to use an Andor iXon3 camera in the OpenSPIM setup. This camera 
works well in standalone installations of the micromanager (MM), I tried 
them more. However, when I copy, according to instructions in the web, 
the corresponding dll to MM included in OpenSPIM sw, it does not work. I 
also used Dependency Walker as there described.

Could anybody help me, please? What is the number of MM version used in 
the OpenSPIM from February 7 2014 ? I see only 1.4.x dev, which is 
probably not enough to choose the proper one.

Any comment will be welcome.

Thank you very much in advance!
Martin

Hi R?diger,

why do you think you need a 4-lens SPIM?

For most purposes a 3-lens SPIM (or even a 2-lens SPIM) is just fine. The 4-lens system requires a second detection arm, including another camera, which is one of the most expensive components of the setup. The main advantage of the 4-lens system is the ability to record the back side of the sample right after the front side without rotation. When the two cameras are well aligned, both views are automatically registered. This pays off when you want to process the data in realtime [Schmid, 2013; Krzic, 2012]. Otherwise, there is not much of a speed advantage comparing it with a three-lens SPIM with a fast rotational motor.

Here are some examples of 4-lens SPIM setups.

Hi Openspim community!

I am assembling a system at UCLA and would like to know if anyone is successfully using the openspim software with a flash4.0 camera? If so, what may I ask what is the specific method to connect and control the Flash4.0 with a 32bit computer running windows XP? I did not think this was possible but according to other posts, some may have solved this issue.

Also, is there any update with using this system for Windows 7 (64-bit), or even just connecting the PICARD stage with micromanager running on Windows 7? I have not yet been able to achieve either objective.

Any help or advice is much appreciated!

Thanks!

Could you please clarify how it does not work? When in Hardware Configuration, is the 'Andor' device not listed? Is it listed, but with a gray dot next to it? Is it available, but gives an error when you try to add it?


Which instructions did you follow, exactly? And did the Dependency Walker show any errors?


> Could anybody help me, please? What is the number of MM version used in the OpenSPIM from February 7 2014 ? I see only 1.4.x dev, which is probably not enough to choose the proper one.


As near as I can determine, OpenSPIM from 7 Feb 2014 is based on[1] Micro-Manager v1.4.16 (which was released 31 January, 2014). This means that copying DLLs from that version of Micro-Manager to OpenSPIM's mm/win32 directory should work. If it does not, please try downloading the nightly build from 5 February 2014[2]:


- From the Micro-Manager website, click 'Downloads'.
- On the left, click 'Download Nightly Builds'.
- Click 'Version 1.4 (Windows)'.
- Scroll through the list looking for 'MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe'.


That version of Micro-Manager should be completely compatible with OpenSPIM.


I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you continue to run into problems.


Thanks,
Luke


[1] To be completely precise, it is based on SVN revision r12726, dated 5 February 2014. This was shortly after the release of 1.4.16 as I mention above.
[2] The direct link is: http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe -- however, please always beware of direct links in e-mails! It is safer to find the file yourself, from a trusted website.

There seems to be a lot of interest in this camera! Do you know, does it work with ordinary Micro-Manager on Windows XP 32-bit? If so, it should work without issue in OpenSPIM as well, since we use the same code...


But I gather the problem might be the first part -- according to the DCAM-API website, the Flash4.0 requires hardware (a capture card) that does not support Windows XP. However, it claims to support Windows 7 32-bit; I believe OpenSPIM will run on that operating system as well...





The Hiedelberg Group has apparently used this camera successfully:?http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F Although I do not know if they are using 32- or 64-bit.






> Also, is there any update with using this system for Windows 7 (64-bit), or even just connecting the PICARD stage with micromanager running on Windows 7? I have not yet been able to achieve either objective.




We're working on cleaning up the PicardStage device adapter. Once we have, we hope to submit it upstream, to Micro-Manager, to be included in their future builds -- both 32- and 64-bit. However, since we aren't there just yet, I will provide some more detailed answers to these questions:


To the first part of your question, yes -- in a sense, this is our active goal. The device adapter can already build in 64-bit[1], and since the OpenSPIM plugin is Java (and will run anywhere), our biggest obstacle is making the 64-bit device adapter available. Some people who have contacted this list have built the device adapter for themselves and gotten it working, so it's certainly possible!


I hope this answers some of your questions; if you have more, feel free to send another e-mail to the list!


Thanks,
Luke


[1] If you're feeling daring, and have some programming experience, see?http://openspim.org/How_to_build_the_software#The_easy_way for details on setting up the development environment we use to advance the OpenSPIM software. From there, you should be able to build our device adapter in the Release x64 configuration. If you want to go this route and have some time to invest, please e-mail me again, and I can try to provide more detailed instructions!

Hi all,

We're using an orca flash 4 v2 with the latest openspim release (we use the
active silicon Phoenix grabber rather than usb3). It is running on a
Windows 7/64 machine with the openspim software launched in 32bit
compatibility mode (java errors if we dont). We're still in testing but it
seems to work ok. We'll use this and if a native 64 bit friendly release
eventuates then we will switch.

Based on this, I see no reason why it couldn't work. Perhaps if not on
XP/32 then on 7/32.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

Thank you for your advice! I do, however, still have some problems...

When I try to run ImageJ-win32 from the openSPIM.app in 32bit compatibility mode (on my win7x64 machine), micromanager gives me the error "failed to open libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilibmmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V"

When I try to run the program through XP mode via native virtualization software in win7, neither the PICARD stage (through usb hub) nor the flash4v2 (via capture card) are recognized. Both are recognized in windows 7x64. I also did install correct device drivers for both in virtual xp mode. 

I'll try to run win7_32bit natively on this computer. 

Another question I have is concerning the laser. I am using a 50mW coherent sapphire laser. Is it necessary to load the laser into the configuration? and if so, do I just add the .dll to the mmplugin folder?

Thanks!
-Peter

Hi Peter,

I just performed the setup as explained in the wiki. Yes though, we're
using the 50mW coherent 488 cube and with the options set it works ok.
I haven't seen that error and im on vacation at the moment so can't check
the setup directly.

I have to make mention that the picard software that picard supplies
doesn't drive the stage at all, however openspim micromanager does. I'm not
sure if others have encountered this with win7/64.

One final thing, on drivers,coherent still doesnt have a 64bit usb driver
for the cube series. So you have no choice but to use serial to control the
laser rather than usb (might be worth adding to the wiki).

Cheers Kieran

Hi Luke,
Andor works now!

I installed the recommended nightly build of MM (a win32 version for 
WinXP-32bit) and copied the following files from it to OpenSPIM sw: 
mmgr_dal_Andor.dll + atmcd32d.dll (detected by Dependency Walker) and 
MultiCamera.jar (from mmplugins). Thus, I have got the full control over 
Andor.

When I did the same with MM v1.4.16, "Andor" was with a grey dot with 
the comment "(unavailable)".

Thank you very much for your help!
Martin

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Light Sheet Beam Profiles at Objective Focus
Message-ID: <53509003.7040103@emory.edu>

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody knows a good reference that describes the 
beam profile of the light sheet at the focus of an objective lens. I 
know that Dodt et al have some equations to describe the profile after 
focusing using a cylindrical lens.  How is the profile affected when 
cylindrical lens is focused on the back focal plane of the objective lens?

Buyaert and Dirchx OSA 2009 mention the focus of the cylindrical lens 
being a hyperbola instead of Dodt's standard Gaussian beam waist 
profile.  Which one is correct for the cylindrical lens focus?

Either way, it would be great to know how to correctly model the 
expected light sheet coming out of the objective.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Hi,

 

I met a problem that John met last year
http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2013-December/000295.html

 

However, The problem is still there after I update Fiji. 

 

When I first updated, I remember there are information similar like: 

 

below should be updated, and other updates are based on them:
jars/perf4j-0.9.13.jar, jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar,
jars/natire-lib-loader-2.00.jar.

 

Could you help how to solve it? Thanks.

 

Best regards,

 

Zuomin

Subject: [OpenSPIM] stradus laser in OpenSPIM
Message-ID: <001701cf6466$52bca410$f835ec30$@ee.oulu.fi>

Dear Sir,

 

We used a stradus laser in OpenSPIM. But we cannot open the Acquire OpenSPIM
option from Micro-manager. The settings can be seen in attachments. It
always shows error like "Error in device VLTStradus: Duplicate property
names are not allowed"

 

Now we use one stradus laser with wavelength 561 nm, I cannot understand
where "duplicate property names" happens. 

 

Another problem is the information in Corelog20140430 that "Startup script
file (C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Fiji.app/MMStartup.bsh) not present." I do not
know why miss this file MMSartup.bsh. How handle it?

 

Could you help us? Thank you very much.

 

Best regards,

 

Zuomin Zhao

Since the Stradus device adapter is "secret", my ability to help is limited. My suggestion is:
- First, please make sure you are using the Stradus device adapter (mmgr_dal_Stradus.dll) from the 5 February 2014 nightly build of Micro-Manager[1].
- Run OpenSPIM, but before clicking "Acquire SPIM Image", create a pixel size:
 - On Micro-Manager, click "Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration..."
 - Click "New"
 - Set Label to "Uncalibrated"
 - Set Pixel Size (um/pixel) to 1.00
 - Across from "Core - Initialize" click "Use" checkbox.
 - Click "OK".
- Try "Acquire SPIM Image" again.

This error should not cause any problems right now. It only means that the "Acquire SPIM Image" window will not open automatically.


If you continue to have trouble, please e-mail us again and I will try to help more.

I don't have time to look into the duplicate property issue today, but
FYI the Stradus adapter is open source, and the source is in
DeviceAdapters/Vortran (can't blame you for missing it).

Hi all,

in the OpenSPIM project, we tried TheImagingSource cameras first (we had
some heat-related problems which I *suspected* to be caused by the
Firewire-to-USB adapter embedded into the camera). My overall impression
was very good, though: the cameras are affordable and produce a decent
image quality, so I would like to bring the announcement below to your
attention.

Ciao,

Well, somewhere, Alexis is shaking his head. ;-) He did, after all, warn us about this...


Please try the following:
1. Check that the file "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" exists (it probably does).
2. Send a new CoreLog (from a day when this error was encountered) to me.
3. Download a new, 32-bit version of Micro-Manager from the website[1] and install it.
4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).
5. Try launching the software again. If it still fails, send me yet another CoreLog.


Thanks again, and I'm sorry for the trouble!
Luke

The file seems to indicate that a necessary JAR file is missing for OME-TIFF output -- the most likely candidate is OpenSPIM.app/jars/bio-formats/formats-api-5.0.0.jar (the latest version available through the Fiji Updater).

Our plugin does not currently come with Micro-Manager, so if you download Micro-Manager's latest version from their website, you won't be able to control an OpenSPIM. The Fiji updater, on the other hand, downloads newer versions of the files OpenSPIM relies on.

Unfortunately, we've begun working to submit the PicardStage device adapter to Micro-Manager, which is going to take up a significant amount of my time for the next few days...

Hopefully this will be the case! There have been a few other changes to the code, but ideally, it will work as described. However, the true utility of the update is that it can, with a few changes to some Java code, control almost any device.


The Cobolt device adapter, in particular, should already be working. I haven't yet been able to test this, of course, but in working with Cristian to get their setup working, hopefully any major issues will present themselves.


The main problem I'm aware of presently is that the Cobolt device adapter on the OpenSPIM update site (that is, the file obtained when running the Fiji updater) may be an outdated version. OpenSPIM should be able to support the latest DLL from Micro-Manager, however, so copying the file from a fresh MM install may be a temporary workaround until I get a moment to fix this.


Thanks again for your offer to help! The biggest issue is to test the paragraph above:
- Will a fresh install of OpenSPIM, fully updated, control a Cobolt laser without trouble?
- If the DLL won't load, will the current version from Micro-Manager load?
- Once a loading DLL is found (and, for my part, uploaded to the update site), will the plugin be able to control it seamlessly?


If you can find any answers to those questions, I'd greatly appreciate it!


Thanks,
Luke

On our setup, we would like to measure precisely the width of the lightsheet at the focal point, but I'm running out of ideas to do that, as the resolution of our beam profiler is not able to go down to the size of it. Is anyone of you have a trick to do that ? 

Cheers

Dear Julien!

you should use a mirror mounted under 45°. This is described in detail in http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1533/pdf/huisken_phd.pdf, or e.g. in http://staff.science.nus.edu.sg/~chmwt/publications/Singh%20AP%202013%202D%20array_supplementary.pdf and http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/publications/files/spimfccs2013_supplement.pdf

Then you can do a Gaussian fit to cuts through the light sheet.

Best,
JAN

Hi Luke,

Well, somewhere, Alexis is shaking his head. ;-) He did, after all, warn us about this...
:D 

Please try the following:
1. Check that the file "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" exists (it probably does).
	Yes, the file exists
2. Send a new CoreLog (from a day when this error was encountered) to me.
	Sending the corelog: CoreLog20140402.txt
3. Download a new, 32-bit version of Micro-Manager from the website[1] and install it.
	Downloaded and installed the last version (32bit_1.4.16)
4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).
	I didn`t find the file in "Program Files x86" (althought we are using "Windows 7_64bit"), I copied the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\"
5. Try launching the software again. If it still fails, send me yet another CoreLog.
	I launched the "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app", loading the Configuration File "OpenSPIM01.app.cfg" and I had no problem recognized the devices, but now when I click "Plugins" in the MicroManager windows, don´t appear nothing! :O
I sending the second CoreLog for today (CoreLog20140407.txt).

Other data: 1) A message appeared to update Java for Windows, would be necessary?. 2) when I specified a new directory for ex. a "file 1" in the desktop, the pic was no taken or the time-lapse don`t start, but also, if I had some file inside the "file 1", these were deleted without any notice!.

Thanks to you for the help!, I guess the idea is that all we go to cooperate with the project.
:-)
Best,

Cristian


Thanks again, and I'm sorry for the trouble!

The file seems to indicate that a necessary JAR file is missing for OME-TIFF output -- the most likely candidate is OpenSPIM.app/jars/bio-formats/formats-api-5.0.0.jar (the latest version available through the Fiji Updater).

Our plugin does not currently come with Micro-Manager, so if you download Micro-Manager's latest version from their website, you won't be able to control an OpenSPIM.

Odd. This core log, and the next one, suggest that the OpenSPIM plugin isn't up-to-date. Please check the following:

1. Run the software and click "Help -> Update Fiji"
2. If the software says, "Your ImageJ is up to date!", please let me know (but click "OK" and continue with these instructions).
3. Click "Advanced Mode" in the lower-right corner.
4. At the top of the window, change "View Options" to "View files of the 'OpenSPIM' site".
5. If anything in the list is not "Up-to-date", click on the status/action and set it to "Update it" or "Install it".
6. Click "Apply changes" to update all of OpenSPIM's files.
7. Restart the software, and see if the plugin shows up now.


If you're still having trouble after this, I'll want to explore the problem more directly. If the software still isn't working, please:
1. Click "Plugins -> Utilities -> Make Fiji Package".
2. For type, select "ZIP" and click "OK".
3. Save the package somewhere you'll remember. (The Desktop works.)
4. Let the plugin run until it tells you, "Wrote <file name>", then click "OK".
5. Click "Help -> Upload Sample Image".
6. Browse to where you saved the file, select it, and click "Open".
7. Wait for the upload to finish.


>> 4. Copy the file "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\mmgr_dal_Cobolt.dll" [2] to "C:\Users\User\Desktop\OpenSPIM.app\mm\win32\" (and overwrite the file that exists there).

> Other data: 1) A message appeared to update Java for Windows, would be necessary?.
It should not be, but I've just noticed that OpenSPIM may not have been packaged with Java. If you downloaded the software very recently (OpenSPIM-20140207.zip), it may be using your system Java instead of its own. 


> 2) when I specified a new directory for ex. a "file 1" in the desktop, the pic was no taken or the time-lapse don`t start, but also, if I had some file inside the "file 1", these were deleted without any notice!.
This behavior was certainly removed from recent versions of OpenSPIM. (To be precise, it was removed on 26 August 2013 -- the latest version of OpenSPIM is from 7 February 2014.) For some reason, it seems your update updated everything except OpenSPIM itself.


> Thanks to you for the help!, I guess the idea is that all we go to cooperate with the project.
Every little bit helps! You may not be the only person having trouble with our software, but only the first to contact us -- and so if we can fix this issue, it will benefit the project as a whole. :)



Once again, thanks for your cooperation.
Luke

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Slit aperture function
Message-ID: <CAADJ=-qXqcrGo+LSBwhGOOj_KZGBV9+wiHuYS91q_1F6+8E2ng@mail.gmail.com>

Dear SPIM folks,

i) A big Thank You to the many people involved in setting up this fantastic
source! It gave me a lot of confidence in building my own light sheet,
knowing there's a great reference like this - excellent instructions,
theoretical background, software and all - seriously genius!

ii) Apologies in advance, this might expand a bit - but I would like to get
some clarification on the slit, and its influence on the light sheet. So
the slit truncates the expanded Gaussian beam (1), already forming a light
sheet (2). The cylindrical lens then focusses this sheet in one dimension.
An a- or apochromatic objective lens can be used after that (3) for further
focussing. Alternatively, a cylindrical lens can be used on its own to
create a light sheet (4) (stop me if I'm off).
Now, the questions are these:
   a) A wide open slit shortens the Rayleigh range. But it also seems to
have less uniformity not only along the axis of propagation, but also
perpendicular to it (i.e. travelling along the waist), since the slit
aperture produces an 'Airy line' with higher order diffraction patterns
causing minima and maxima. Is there any description of this in the
literature?
   b) Conversely, if a thicker (= larger waist) light sheet with less
intensity is acceptable, the slit can be closed narrowly, and the central
zeroth order maximum expands. Is this, as appears to me, the most uniform
part of the light sheet? I couldn't find any information on the aperture of
the slit.
   c) There is a host of different formulae for calculating the theoretical
dimensions of a light sheet (e.g. 5,6). The openSPIM calculator widget of
Peter and Tobias mentions two slits, horizontal and vertical. Which formula
underpins this? And why two slits?

I currently don't use a slit for my meso-/macroscopic setup for corals, but
am intrigued by this (and discussed it with some SPIMmers here, without
really getting anywhere).

With many, many thanks

Philippe

Hi Luke!

The force is with us!! :D
After the update via "Advanced Mode", appeared two updates, one for the "Hamamatsu camera" and one for the "SPIMAcquisition", I apply the changes, restart the app and after that, the software is working wonderful!. I can save the experiment in another directory (always delete the data inside the selected file!, but now displays a warning), and hence, we can use the computer storage (300Gb).
I started a time-lapse and everything wasl ok, saved in the correct directory etc.
Thanks a lot for the help to everybody!, Jan-Felix, Alexis and Luke!, when I go to Germany, I`ll take a good chilean wine for each.
:-)
Best regards to all,

Cristian

Hi cristian,

I am happy to read that you were fearless and updated. 
Basically by simply swapping the cobolt device adapter currently shipping with MM in place  of the one bundled with OpenSpIm solves your issue and showed that it works out-of-the-box. 
This is great news as it means no modification of the driver required. 
Thanks again for your leap of faith. 
You are more adventurous than me. 

@luke: this basically answers many of the questions you had, no? 

Best,

Alexis

Our plugin does not currently come with Micro-Manager, so if you download Micro-Manager's latest version from their website, you won't be able to control an OpenSPIM.

Hey Jan,

I started a page about light sheet characterization in the wiki, maybe you want to contribute to it?

Dear OPEN-SPIM team,

your website is terrific!
Since a while we are now getting more and more interested in setting up our own SPIM for a multitude of potential applications.
My impression is, that for many purposes a dual color-X-SPIM would be needed.
You show nice pictures on your page of such a system (X-SPIM), but in the parts list the corresponding chamber is not listed.
Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under „OPEN SPIM“ at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

Thanks a lot in advance, looking forward to hearing from you!
Best regards, Rüdiger

Dear All,

I had measured the light sheet using 45 degree mirror last week and I had also did a Gaussian fit for it. I will happily share the data with everyone here. Attached are the max intensity projection along x-axis and the FWHM measurement. The max intensity projection shows the light sheet along different x-position as I move the mirror.

Dear OPEN-SPIM team,

your website is terrific!
Since a while we are now getting more and more interested in setting up our own SPIM for a multitude of potential applications.
My impression is, that for many purposes a dual color-X-SPIM would be needed.
You show nice pictures on your page of such a system (X-SPIM), but in the parts list the corresponding chamber is not listed.
Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under ?OPEN SPIM? at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

Thanks a lot in advance, looking forward to hearing from you!
Best regards, R?diger

The picture of X-OpenSPIM is a model, it does not exist (at least not to my knowledge). One can in principle build such a microscope, but it will necessarily involve some technology development. 

> Do you, in general, sell the parts listed under „OPEN SPIM“ at the prices indicated on your page and do you also distribute the chambers for X-SPIM?

We don't sell anything. The parts are obtainable from standard manufacturers as indicated. Custom parts need to be done either by your workshop according to the provided plans or you can click on the email icon next to the parts list and get them from Pieter Fourie in South Africa.

All the best

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Andor iXon3 camera
Message-ID: <5347F2C9.9040502@biomed.cas.cz>

Dear all,

I need to use an Andor iXon3 camera in the OpenSPIM setup. This camera 
works well in standalone installations of the micromanager (MM), I tried 
them more. However, when I copy, according to instructions in the web, 
the corresponding dll to MM included in OpenSPIM sw, it does not work. I 
also used Dependency Walker as there described.

Could anybody help me, please? What is the number of MM version used in 
the OpenSPIM from February 7 2014 ? I see only 1.4.x dev, which is 
probably not enough to choose the proper one.

Any comment will be welcome.

Thank you very much in advance!
Martin

Hi Rüdiger,

why do you think you need a 4-lens SPIM?

For most purposes a 3-lens SPIM (or even a 2-lens SPIM) is just fine. The 4-lens system requires a second detection arm, including another camera, which is one of the most expensive components of the setup. The main advantage of the 4-lens system is the ability to record the back side of the sample right after the front side without rotation. When the two cameras are well aligned, both views are automatically registered. This pays off when you want to process the data in realtime [Schmid, 2013; Krzic, 2012]. Otherwise, there is not much of a speed advantage comparing it with a three-lens SPIM with a fast rotational motor.

Here are some examples of 4-lens SPIM setups.

Message-ID: <AC7656D1-8CF8-4D7C-8FB4-8C4C9E84B9BE@physics.ucla.edu>

Hi Openspim community!

I am assembling a system at UCLA and would like to know if anyone is successfully using the openspim software with a flash4.0 camera? If so, what may I ask what is the specific method to connect and control the Flash4.0 with a 32bit computer running windows XP? I did not think this was possible but according to other posts, some may have solved this issue.

Also, is there any update with using this system for Windows 7 (64-bit), or even just connecting the PICARD stage with micromanager running on Windows 7? I have not yet been able to achieve either objective.

Any help or advice is much appreciated!

Thanks!

Could you please clarify how it does not work? When in Hardware Configuration, is the 'Andor' device not listed? Is it listed, but with a gray dot next to it? Is it available, but gives an error when you try to add it?


Which instructions did you follow, exactly? And did the Dependency Walker show any errors?


> Could anybody help me, please? What is the number of MM version used in the OpenSPIM from February 7 2014 ? I see only 1.4.x dev, which is probably not enough to choose the proper one.


As near as I can determine, OpenSPIM from 7 Feb 2014 is based on[1] Micro-Manager v1.4.16 (which was released 31 January, 2014). This means that copying DLLs from that version of Micro-Manager to OpenSPIM's mm/win32 directory should work. If it does not, please try downloading the nightly build from 5 February 2014[2]:


- From the Micro-Manager website, click 'Downloads'.
- On the left, click 'Download Nightly Builds'.
- Click 'Version 1.4 (Windows)'.
- Scroll through the list looking for 'MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe'.


That version of Micro-Manager should be completely compatible with OpenSPIM.


I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you continue to run into problems.


Thanks,
Luke


[1] To be completely precise, it is based on SVN revision r12726, dated 5 February 2014. This was shortly after the release of 1.4.16 as I mention above.
[2] The direct link is: http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_1.4.17_20140205.exe -- however, please always beware of direct links in e-mails! It is safer to find the file yourself, from a trusted website.

There seems to be a lot of interest in this camera! Do you know, does it work with ordinary Micro-Manager on Windows XP 32-bit? If so, it should work without issue in OpenSPIM as well, since we use the same code...


But I gather the problem might be the first part -- according to the DCAM-API website, the Flash4.0 requires hardware (a capture card) that does not support Windows XP. However, it claims to support Windows 7 32-bit; I believe OpenSPIM will run on that operating system as well...





The Hiedelberg Group has apparently used this camera successfully: http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F Although I do not know if they are using 32- or 64-bit.

We're working on cleaning up the PicardStage device adapter. Once we have, we hope to submit it upstream, to Micro-Manager, to be included in their future builds -- both 32- and 64-bit. However, since we aren't there just yet, I will provide some more detailed answers to these questions:


To the first part of your question, yes -- in a sense, this is our active goal. The device adapter can already build in 64-bit[1], and since the OpenSPIM plugin is Java (and will run anywhere), our biggest obstacle is making the 64-bit device adapter available. Some people who have contacted this list have built the device adapter for themselves and gotten it working, so it's certainly possible!


I hope this answers some of your questions; if you have more, feel free to send another e-mail to the list!


Thanks,
Luke

Hi all,

We're using an orca flash 4 v2 with the latest openspim release (we use the
active silicon Phoenix grabber rather than usb3). It is running on a
Windows 7/64 machine with the openspim software launched in 32bit
compatibility mode (java errors if we dont). We're still in testing but it
seems to work ok. We'll use this and if a native 64 bit friendly release
eventuates then we will switch.

Based on this, I see no reason why it couldn't work. Perhaps if not on
XP/32 then on 7/32.

Cheers Kieran

Hi Kieran,

Thank you for your advice! I do, however, still have some problems...

When I try to run ImageJ-win32 from the openSPIM.app in 32bit compatibility mode (on my win7x64 machine), micromanager gives me the error "failed to open libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilibmmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V"

When I try to run the program through XP mode via native virtualization software in win7, neither the PICARD stage (through usb hub) nor the flash4v2 (via capture card) are recognized. Both are recognized in windows 7x64. I also did install correct device drivers for both in virtual xp mode. 

I'll try to run win7_32bit natively on this computer. 

Another question I have is concerning the laser. I am using a 50mW coherent sapphire laser. Is it necessary to load the laser into the configuration? and if so, do I just add the .dll to the mmplugin folder?

Thanks!
-Peter

Hi Peter,

I just performed the setup as explained in the wiki. Yes though, we're
using the 50mW coherent 488 cube and with the options set it works ok.
I haven't seen that error and im on vacation at the moment so can't check
the setup directly.

I have to make mention that the picard software that picard supplies
doesn't drive the stage at all, however openspim micromanager does. I'm not
sure if others have encountered this with win7/64.

One final thing, on drivers,coherent still doesnt have a 64bit usb driver
for the cube series. So you have no choice but to use serial to control the
laser rather than usb (might be worth adding to the wiki).

Cheers Kieran

Hi Luke,
Andor works now!

I installed the recommended nightly build of MM (a win32 version for 
WinXP-32bit) and copied the following files from it to OpenSPIM sw: 
mmgr_dal_Andor.dll + atmcd32d.dll (detected by Dependency Walker) and 
MultiCamera.jar (from mmplugins). Thus, I have got the full control over 
Andor.

When I did the same with MM v1.4.16, "Andor" was with a grey dot with 
the comment "(unavailable)".

Thank you very much for your help!
Martin

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Light Sheet Beam Profiles at Objective Focus
Message-ID: <53509003.7040103@emory.edu>

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody knows a good reference that describes the 
beam profile of the light sheet at the focus of an objective lens. I 
know that Dodt et al have some equations to describe the profile after 
focusing using a cylindrical lens.  How is the profile affected when 
cylindrical lens is focused on the back focal plane of the objective lens?

Buyaert and Dirchx OSA 2009 mention the focus of the cylindrical lens 
being a hyperbola instead of Dodt's standard Gaussian beam waist 
profile.  Which one is correct for the cylindrical lens focus?

Either way, it would be great to know how to correctly model the 
expected light sheet coming out of the objective.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Neil

Message-ID: <00a501cf6092$ff9bdc50$fed394f0$@ee.oulu.fi>

Hi,

 

I met a problem that John met last year
http://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/2013-December/000295.html

 

However, The problem is still there after I update Fiji. 

 

When I first updated, I remember there are information similar like: 

 

below should be updated, and other updates are based on them:
jars/perf4j-0.9.13.jar, jars/kryo-2.21-shaded.jar,
jars/natire-lib-loader-2.00.jar.

 

Could you help how to solve it? Thanks.

 

Best regards,

 

Zuomin

Message-ID: <001701cf6466$52bca410$f835ec30$@ee.oulu.fi>

Dear Sir,

 

We used a stradus laser in OpenSPIM. But we cannot open the Acquire OpenSPIM
option from Micro-manager. The settings can be seen in attachments. It
always shows error like "Error in device VLTStradus: Duplicate property
names are not allowed"

 

Now we use one stradus laser with wavelength 561 nm, I cannot understand
where "duplicate property names" happens. 

 

Another problem is the information in Corelog20140430 that "Startup script
file (C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Fiji.app/MMStartup.bsh) not present." I do not
know why miss this file MMSartup.bsh. How handle it?

 

Could you help us? Thank you very much.

 

Best regards,

 

Zuomin Zhao

Since the Stradus device adapter is "secret", my ability to help is limited. My suggestion is:
- First, please make sure you are using the Stradus device adapter (mmgr_dal_Stradus.dll) from the 5 February 2014 nightly build of Micro-Manager[1].
- Run OpenSPIM, but before clicking "Acquire SPIM Image", create a pixel size:
 - On Micro-Manager, click "Tools -> Pixel Size Calibration..."
 - Click "New"
 - Set Label to "Uncalibrated"
 - Set Pixel Size (um/pixel) to 1.00
 - Across from "Core - Initialize" click "Use" checkbox.
 - Click "OK".
- Try "Acquire SPIM Image" again.

This error should not cause any problems right now. It only means that the "Acquire SPIM Image" window will not open automatically.


If you continue to have trouble, please e-mail us again and I will try to help more.

I don't have time to look into the duplicate property issue today, but
FYI the Stradus adapter is open source, and the source is in
DeviceAdapters/Vortran (can't blame you for missing it).

Best,
