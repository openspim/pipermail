<PRE>Hi Aurelia,

&gt;<i> I'm running into a problem when I try to configure my 4D stage. If I configure using the January 31 2013 OpenSPIM download, without updating through the website first, the Picard stage loads and works normally. However once I run the update, the stage can't be found (I get the error message, &quot;OpenSPIM Unable to load library: file not accessible or corrupted,&quot; and it appears as &quot;Picard stage (unavailable)&quot; in the hardware configuration wizard list of devices. Has anyone else had this problem?
</I>The error message itself is expected now; the old mmgr_dal_OpenSPIM.dll file is deprecated (meaning when you update, it deletes that file). As Johannes explained, you'll need to re-make the configuration file to use the new device adapter.


In the list of devices, is there also a 'PicardStage' subtree you can see? If so, the devices there should be used instead of those under OpenSPIM. Once your configuration files no longer try to use OpenSPIM, 


If not (which is what the &quot;(unavailable)&quot; seems to be indicating), please make sure that the PiUsb.dll file exists in the same directory as mmgr_dal_PicardStage.dll (which should be, from the ImageJ/Fiji directory, in &quot;mm/win32/&quot;). If this file is missing for some reason, running the Fiji Updater might restore it.


If the above doesn't help solve the problem, you can try using the Fiji Updater's advanced mode: After launching the updater, click &quot;Advanced Mode&quot;. At the top of the window is &quot;View Options:&quot; -- set it to &quot;View files of the 'OpenSPIM' site&quot;. In the list of files, look for &quot;mm/win32/PiUsb.dll&quot;. The second column should show the status of that file: &quot;Up-to-date&quot; or perhaps &quot;Not installed&quot;. If the file is marked as &quot;Not installed&quot; or &quot;Update available&quot;, clicking on that text should allow you to set it to &quot;Install / Update&quot;; from there, clicking &quot;Apply Changes&quot; will install the missing file. (If the file is marked as &quot;Up-to-date&quot;, then some other problem is making the PicardStage adapter unavailable -- please let me know if this is the case.)


&gt;<i> Also, the MicroManager version changes to 1.4.x dev after I run the updater; is that as it should be? I would simply not update, except that I need to do so for my camera to be recognized. 
</I>The change in Micro-Manager version is also expected; part of the recent updates was to switch to a newer version of the underlying Micro-Manager code.



&gt;<i> A second question: is there any possibility or plan for the OpenSPIM software to be made compatible with Windows 7? I can&#39;t acquire a new computer and run XP on it anymore, as our computing department won&#39;t purchase XP now that it&#39;s not supported. I&#39;m using an older machine with XP now, to set up, but I suspect it will be inadequate once I&#39;m acquiring real data sets. 
</I>As Johannes pointed out, this may already be possible provided the latest DCAM driver is used. There are plans to make Windows 7 officially supported in the future.



Please let me know if this doesn't help solve the problem!


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg
