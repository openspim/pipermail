As luck has it, I gave a talk in Mark's group last Thursday. They also
gave me a quite thorough introduction into their OPT setup. With a little
bit of hardware design, we should be able to make a custom &quot;OpenOPT&quot;, i.e.
adapting OpenSPIM for OPT imaging. The biggest problem is that we'd need
at least 400 rotation steps, better something like 1200 (or a very fast
camera and a continuous, low-speed rotation). I am not quite sure how we
could get that, probably we'd need to contact Picard systems.

The good news is that almost all the software required to reconstruct the
3D images from the projections is Open Source, i.e. it is accessible and
adaptable.

Ciao,
Dscho
