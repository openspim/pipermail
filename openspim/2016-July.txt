Subject: [OpenSPIM] Follow-up: [Open-SPIM] Is anyone using digital scanning
 to reduce banding?
Message-ID: <D3A12955.ECFB%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hi folks,

Many thanks for your help.  After much testing I have concluded that anti-striping along the lines of Huisken & Stainier (2007) is extremely important for imaging large structures like a zebrafish embryo.  This adds significant complexity and cost (~$2,000) to the basic openSPIM design but in my opinion it makes the instrument dramatically more useful for segmentation and quantiative imaging.  Importantly the fact that I could make it suggests that it is within the engineering abilities of most people who can build an openSPIM.  We have not started using it yet as our lasers are also out for an upgrade; I will update the list when I have had a chance to test it.

I had to fill in some details from the 2007 paper on my own, so it is likely that more elegant/less kludgy designs exist.  Still, this guide I wrote for our group may be useful for those thinking of adding anti-striping in the future.

Dear Tim,

I think you are mixing up two issue.

1. Getting rid of stripes.

Yes, you can do a little bit in post-processing but the stripes can be quite complex and are not necessarily straight. Oftentimes you see a lot of lensing and I do not think you can easily remove it with image processing.

a) Double-sided illumination helps. Depending on the sample you may want to do simultaneous or sequential double-sided illumination. There are various ways of merging the two images.
b) A resonant mSPIM mirror is cheap and easy to integrate. You will get rid of most stripes, but again this depends on the sample. The details for a) and b) are in our Opt. Lett. paper (Huisken & Stainier, 2007). Basically, you are pivoting the light sheet around the center of your field of view, e.g. with 1kHz. The stripes are "washed out" during the exposure time of your camera. We use this on most of our systems and it helps a lot to reduce stripes.
c) Multi-view fusion can also help to some extent.

2. DSLM vs. SPIM

Yes, DSLM should also help reducing stripes but I have no experience with that. Basically, your light sheet is not coherent anymore and the sheet does not "interfere with itself". However, the setup is more expensive and requires you to power and control another element: the galvo scanner to sweep the beam up and down. You need a proper scan mirror and not just the cheap mSPIM mirror. The additional benefit is that the resulting light sheet is more uniform than the cropped Gaussian light sheet. However, you need to illuminate each line with higher intensity which may result in saturation and worse dynamic range. Obviously you need to wait for the scan and need to synchronize your readout. Depending whether you have a global shutter or rolling shutter camera you need to take some precaution.

Best
Jan

In related news I just noticed that the TeraStitcher plugin for Vaa3D now
has an option to fight banding in light sheet data.  I have not tested it

stitches really well but it could be a hair more user-friendly.

Hi Tim,

I would be very interested in an example "before and after" image once you  
have them!

Hi Tim,

great! I like your setup.

One remark to the last figure caption in your document: You need to adjust the amplitude to get the maximum efficiency of the mSPIM. You start with a small amplitude and increase it until the light sheet intensity (and fluorescence) drops. Now you have found the amplitude where you pivot the sheet as much as the NA of your illumination lens allows and you are getting the best performance. Going any further, the beam will be cut off and you loose laser power.

Dear Jan and Tim,

Sorry to come into your discussions but I noticed your comment Jan 
concerning this point : a) Double-sided illumination helps. Depending on 
the sample you may want to do simultaneous or sequential double-sided 
illumination. There are various ways of merging the two images.

In our lab we built a home-made ultramicroscope (and reproduce an 
open-spim : 
http://unice.fr/plateformes/mica/ressources/developpements-1/developpements) 
and I was wondering about the best method to fuse images taken from the 
left+those taken from the right from our ultramicroscope (without any 
rotation). At the moment we only do averaging which maybe not the best 
solution, I suppose. Do you know a paper mentionning the different ways 
to do image fusion, or any advice about that (I also knew about a method 
consisting to cut the image in 3 part, but I don't really remember all 
the steps)?

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Frédéric

Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM update site not working?
Message-ID: <DB5PR05MB1559D8CEF7D77BE244DCD481EC300@DB5PR05MB1559.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Team.

I wanted to update my version of the OpenSPIM software and found that the update site link http://openspim.org/update/ appears to be broken. None of the downloads are working either - or the link from the website to the downloads is broken. The updater in my copy of Fiji isn't working either.

Is there somewhere else I can look for either a download (which would be have been updated on 27/4/15 or sooner) or an update?  I wondered if the link had moved. We're trying to get a multiline Versalase working in the SPIM software. Its seems happy in the most recent build of Micromanager. However this was after we asked the guy who wrote the driver for a little code tweak. However we updated the 'OpenSPIM' installation of Micromanager and now the OpenSPIM software won't play. I had thought of starting again with a fresh install when I found the broken link.

Any pointers to where the software is would be most welcome. Am sure this is temporary glitch or maybe a firewall issue but that seems unlikely.

Thanks

Ann

Hi Ann,

Thanks for the report, and my apologies: when upgrading the wiki, I did not
migrate these files properly from the old web server. I have now restored
the missing data.

If anyone notices any other missing or broken functionality, please let me
know.

Regards,
Curtis
