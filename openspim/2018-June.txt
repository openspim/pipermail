Subject: [OpenSPIM] Java Error when starting Fiji
Message-ID: <dc9936139351c6f0b2aa7dc1e60a1287@cam.ac.uk>

Dear All,

Has anybody ever had the error "Could not create the Java virtual 
machine" when starting Fiji (with the OpenSPIM plugin)?


I downloaded Fiji (64-bit) from the OpenSPIM homepage 
(http://openspim.org/Downloads) on a pc running Windows 10 and installed 
the latest Java version (Version 8 Update 171
Release date April 17, 2018). The above mentioned error appears 
instantly when I try to start Fiji.

I tried re-installing Java and increasing the memory following this 
protocol: 
http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-1761312/fix-create-java-virtual-machine-issue.html
This didn't fix the error.

Any ideas how to fix this?

Thank you very much.

Best wishes,
Stephanie

Hi Stephanie,

Have you tried launching ImageJ in debug mode?
  https://imagej.net/Troubleshooting#Launching_ImageJ_from_the_console

Are you using the 64-bit version of Windows 10?

Have you tried using the latest version of the ImageJ Launcher, available
from here:
   https://imagej.net/Launcher#Download
?

Regards,
Curtis
