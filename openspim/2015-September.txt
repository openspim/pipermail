Message-ID: <D20C63BF.53A7%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hello all,

Has anyone found a convenient solution for transmitted light illumination that can be controlled Micro-Manager? On the one hand you can use a handheld flashlight (torch), which works but is not something you can program.  On the other hand you have collimated light sources from e.g. Thorlabs.  Those do the job but they seem excessively powerful and expensive for what should be a pretty basic task.  I went searching for cheap USB-powered lamps that can be controlled through a software interface rather than a physical switch but those seem strangely hard to find.  As it stands I might put a DIY LED bulb in a cheap 'collimator' like the one below and link it to uManager through an arduino.

http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/38/V02-1702EN-107315.pdf

Even so I feel like I must have missed a simpler option.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks and all the best,

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Data Registration Failure
Message-ID: <tencent_5648661F582935EA7FBA45F4@qq.com>

Hi, ALL!
  I bulit my OpenSPIM last week, and I began to require data of zebrafish. But the data was registration failed.  The log of fiji was at the last of this mail. I try to change the threshold and nothing went well. 
  I wonder it's maybe something worry with my require processing,  so I descirbe my require processing below. 
  First, I selected a view, then set the Stack-Z = 400, and the step=7.5um, angle=-55.8.
  Second, I wanted to select another view, so I changed the angle to -19.8. But at the same time, I had to change the x-value to keep the the zebrafish in the view of camera. Of cause, the range of Stack-z was also changed. Was this step wrong? I should not change the x-value?
   Third, I repeated the second step to choose another three views and began to require data.
   I hope to get your help?


   By the way, I found the OpenSPIM.app(20150427) can not do data processing. When I did registration, the program alerted that missing 3D Viewer. I try to download the 3D Viewer, and it could work in this compter. Then I copyed the app folder to another computer, it couldn't work again. Was the 3D Viewer not installed in the app folder?  PS. The computer in lab can not access to Internet.
    Thank you?


Best ALL?

My response isn't really simple but...

I set up oblique illumination and a camera to aid in sample position after occluding the views of the sample chamber with heating and perfusion lines-and a sore neck from constantly checking the chamber during positioning.  It has worked great for positioning zebrafish to organoids.  Right now the illumination is from an old RGB LED board I designed being driven with PWM from a TLC5940 on an Arduino.  The Arduino is also driving an RGB screen for control.  The firmware for the Arduino could be adapted to use a customized version of the Arduino  micromanager driver-haven't gotten to it yet.  For that matter, I'd like the camera feed to be fed to micromanager too.  That's all too much development for me right now though.  I do have an extra RGB board that is populated and could probably dig up a version of the TLC5940 board that is unpopulated(I might have the parts squirreled away) if you're interested-firmwares too of course.

Hi Tim and others,

We use ScopeLED G180 Series RGB LED light source, a fiber light guide and a basic collimator for transmitted light illumination. It is a convenient solution, but not very cheap. The light source can be controlled directly by ?Manager (color, intensity and shutter), and if you use ?Manager multidimensional acquisition (MDA) and channels tools, the bright field imaging can be automatically integrated to time lapse, z-stacking etc. fluorescence experiments. However, on-off cycling and intensity modulation responses seem to have some delay when the device is controlled via USB. Typically it doesn't matter, but it can be a problem if BF and fluorescence channels have to be imaged in a rapid sequence, e.g. in fast time lapse experiments.

RGB color modulation is a nice "extra" feature, since a user can select an appropriate BF illumination color depending on the band pass wavelength of the used emission filter, and use a very little amount of narrow bandwidth light for TL imaging.

Hi everyone,

We've started to build a dual illumination OpenSPIM scope in Newcastle, Australia and our parts are mostly here. Our workstation has just arrived and it's come preinstalled with Windows 8. Before I start putting the software and drivers on, has anyone had any compatibility issues with the OpenSPIM software and this operating system? Would it be wise to step back to Windows 7?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

The main issue with Windows version compatibility is when drivers are 
not quite yet supported. Typically you will find all information 
regarding that on this page:

Dear OpenSpim community members,

I am proud to announce the version 0.1 ?rubber? release of the mu-spim 
<http://mu-spim.xyz/mu_spim_rubber.html>.

It is the first prototype of a light-sheet microscope for smartphones. 
It is still very rough and DIY-ish, but implements the bases of 
light-sheet microscopy.

The design is largely inspired by the SPIM Corinne Lorenzo, Val?rie 
Lobjois, Amina Maandhui and I developed in Toulouse in 2008 - 2010 (this 
one 
<http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/z-outils/images/site/recherche/publis/2010/article-ducommun.jpg>). 
It benefits from the support and partnership of the IP3D team at ITAV 
<http://www.itav-recherche.fr/index.php/fr/menu-itavequipeip3d>.

This project seeks to:

  *

    Popularize microscopy and create vectors for scientists/public
    exchanges, e.g. through the exchange of biologic samples to be
    imaged (see the PrakashLab?s foldscope <http://foldscope.com>). The
    reception so far with lay people is quite positive. I think there
    are many educational opportunities opened, particularly in
    inter-disciplinary settings.

  *

    Create a *compact, field ready, 3D microscope* (on those aspects,
    I?d be happy to ear from tech companies).

    It is for now a *fully open project* (CC-BY-SA-NC), and I am looking
    for any kind of collaboration that could make it progress. This
    early release is a way to find such collaborations.

You can browse the project (openscad based) on github 
<http://github.com/damCB/mu_spim> (getting a github account is painless 
and not intrusive. It is also a very efficient collaboration platform).

Feel free to pass this message along to anyone who might be interested.

Best,

Guillaume

?

Subject: [OpenSPIM] ANN - [mu-spim] mu-spim v0.1 rubber release

Dear OpenSpim community members, 


I am proud to announce the version 0.1 ?rubber? release of the mu-spim . 

It is the first prototype of a light-sheet microscope for smartphones. It is still very rough and DIY-ish, but implements the bases of light-sheet microscopy. 

The design is largely inspired by the SPIM Corinne Lorenzo, Val?rie Lobjois, Amina Maandhui and I developed in Toulouse in 2008 - 2010 ( this one ). It benefits from the support and partnership of the IP3D team at ITAV . 

This project seeks to: 

    * 

Popularize microscopy and create vectors for scientists/public exchanges, e.g. through the exchange of biologic samples to be imaged (see the PrakashLab?s foldscope ). The reception so far with lay people is quite positive. I think there are many educational opportunities opened, particularly in inter-disciplinary settings. 
    * 

Create a compact, field ready, 3D microscope (on those aspects, I?d be happy to ear from tech companies). 

It is for now a fully open project (CC-BY-SA-NC), and I am looking for any kind of collaboration that could make it progress. This early release is a way to find such collaborations. 


You can browse the project (openscad based) on github (getting a github account is painless and not intrusive. It is also a very efficient collaboration platform). 

Feel free to pass this message along to anyone who might be interested. 
Best, 

Guillaume

Hi, everyone,
    Sorry to disturb you again. I try my best to do the registration work, but it didn't work. It still alerts something follow
spim_TL01_Angle2.tif<->spim_TL01_Angle4.tif: Not enough correspondences found 6, should be at least 12
spim_TL01_Angle2.tif<->spim_TL01_Angle3.tif: Model found but not enough remaining inliers (4/12) after RANSAC of 12



    Can someone tell me some possible reasons whick would lead to these errors? Both in the data process and experiment.


    Thank you very much!


All best!

Message-ID: <55F697DF.6000905@ens-lyon.fr>

Hi everyone,

We've got an openspim almost ready to work here in France. We are just 
concerned by the not-very-circular laser beam. Did somebody used a 
pinhole to clean up the beam ? What would be the best location for a 
pinhole in this setup : in the first or the second telescope ? And what 
should be its diameter ? (sorry for the basic questions, not an optical 
engineer !).
Thanks in advance for your help,

Claire

Dear Zheng,

This could mean several things, for example that you do not have enough beads around the sample, do not segment them properly or that your views overlap only minimally and thus do not share enough beads. Another reason might be that you did not enter correct calibration, i.e. the ratio between xy and z dimensions. If that is the case the registration cannot work.

I recommend to read the paper about bead based registration and the documentation on the Fiji wiki [1] to understand what the algorithm is doing and what these reported numbers mean. These are not error messages, they are meant to help you understand where lies the problem in your registration. 

All the best

Dear PAvel?
    Thanks for your reply! I will go to read the documentation as you recommended.
    The xy resolution is just as described in http://openspim.org/Pixel_Size_Calibration (I have done the calibration with rule mode), and the z resolution is just the number of z-step when acquire the data. Is that all right?
    I have antoher question. As in the sample data, there are 0-4 angles for each time lapses. If I want to acquire multi-views for different angles, does only the rotional stage be moved when I change to another view?  The reason for I ask this question is that the detected part of sample would leave the view of CMOS when I just changed the angle stage, and I have to change the x or y stage to move it back. I don't know whether this process lead to the registration fail.


   Thank you for your reply again!

The reason for I ask this question is that the detected part of sample would leave the view of CMOS when I just changed the angle stage, and I have to change the x or y stage to move it back. I don't know whether this process lead to the registration fail.

Each view has to be fully defined by positioning the sample using the xyz motors and defining the first slice, step size and number of slices. The system will try re-visiting these exact locations. If you would just move the rotational stage the sample would most likely disappear from the field of view as it is not centred on the rotation axis and that axis is anyway undefined with our simple sample holder.

All the best

Hi folks,

Thanks to the indispensable help of many users here, our SPIM is up and working.  You are all the best.

Since a SPIM makes it quite hard to change objectives, I bought 1x and a 0.5x C-mount camera adapters to get the equivalent of a 20x and a 10x objective.  It seems to work quite well.  Now I wonder whether anyone has tried a magnifying tube lens like the Olympus U-CA or U-ECA to get a higher power image.  It all depends on whether a 'vanilla' openSPIM design is already imaging near the Nyquist limit.  We get 0.33 um/px using the Olympus 20x/0.5 and a Hamamatsu Flash4.0 v2, and even with deconvolution it may be pointless to magnify the image any further.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Alternatively, has anyone tried keeping a second sample chamber with a higher power objective to swap in as needed?  It seems like a pain but less cumbersome than building a second instrument.

Thanks,


Tim

Hello Timothy,

We use the U-CA to much success... Aligning the light sheet for each mag is highly recommended. I've even use the 0.5x C-mount with it, but that doesn't work with large chip detectors. Another minor issue I have with it is it's range, it only doubles the mag over 4 slots (Empty, 1.25x, 1.6x, & 2.0x).

Thank you Fredrik and Peter!  Right now I am looking at either an Olympus U-AEC 1x/2x magnification changer or else the DE20BXC 2x magnifying camera adapter from SPOT Imaging.

I checked the Nyquist sampling frequency for deconvolution at www.svi.nl/NyquistCalculator, and it looks like magnification is a good idea.  The optimal sampling frequency for widefield with a 0.5 NA water lens is 0.26 um per px.  I am imaging at 0.33 um/px with a 1x camera adapter.  Therefore I have a little resolution to gain, though a 2x adapter at 0.16 um/px will be grossly oversampling.  It might be a good idea to use a 1.5x adapter instead, as 0.22 um/px is pretty close to the theoretical limit.  As I understand it SPIM improves the axial resolution of images but does not change lateral resolution relative to widefield.  Is this correct?

All the best,

?mne: [OpenSPIM] changing "objectives"

Hi folks,

Thanks to the indispensable help of many users here, our SPIM is up and working.  You are all the best.

Since a SPIM makes it quite hard to change objectives, I bought 1x and a 0.5x C-mount camera adapters to get the equivalent of a 20x and a 10x objective.  It seems to work quite well.  Now I wonder whether anyone has tried a magnifying tube lens like the Olympus U-CA or U-ECA to get a higher power image.  It all depends on whether a 'vanilla' openSPIM design is already imaging near the Nyquist limit.  We get 0.33 um/px using the Olympus 20x/0.5 and a Hamamatsu Flash4.0 v2, and even with deconvolution it may be pointless to magnify the image any further.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Alternatively, has anyone tried keeping a second sample chamber with a higher power objective to swap in as needed?  It seems like a pain but less cumbersome than building a second instrument.

Thanks,


Tim

No worries,

"As I understand it SPIM improves the axial resolution of images but does not change lateral resolution relative to widefield.  Is this correct?? Correct. It is in essence a widefield microscope system with optical sectioning in the axial direction.

The optimal sampling frequency for widefield with a 0.5 NA water lens is 0.26 um per px.  I am imaging at 0.33 um/px with a 1x camera adapter.  Therefore I have a little resolution to gain, though a 2x adapter at 0.16 um/px will be grossly oversampling.  It might be a good idea to use a 1.5x adapter instead, as 0.22 um/px is pretty close to the theoretical limit.  As I understand it SPIM improves the axial resolution of images but does not change lateral resolution relative to widefield.  Is this correct?

Subject: [OpenSPIM] pinhole location and diameter to clean up the laser
 beam
In-Reply-To: <55F697DF.6000905@ens-lyon.fr>
References: <55F697DF.6000905@ens-lyon.fr>
Message-ID: <op.x5nzablcahhlbl@pc507-99ff.ibd>

I currently use a low-budget laser diode with terrible beam profile, so  
I'm forced to use a pinhole, but in fact I have a third telescope for  
that, before the entire setup. But I suppose you can try the first  
telescope. In the second telescope, which is after the cylindrical lens,  
the beam has the shape of a line, not a point, so that won't work. The  
size should be calculated dependent on your laser. Describing how to do it  
is slightly too long for an email, but by googling "beam cleaning pinhole  
size" I found for instance this:
http://www.academia.edu/5558409/Laser_beam_cleaning_Spatial_filtering_of_laser_beam_

However, if you do this you'll have a circular beam in the middle and  
diffraction rings around it, like here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk
so you get rid of one problem and introduce another. I suppose you'd have  
to characterize the light-sheet with and without the pinhole to see if it  
helps.

This is from me, maybe somebody has more to add or correct me if I'm wrong.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Jan, I hope the science is treating you well.

Could I ask about the gimbal vs. the 3-axis adjuster.  How much work is it to remove the tilt using the 3-axis version?  I assume you can achieve a pseudo-gimbal by adjusting a little on two screws at a time...?

Or maybe, to come at the question from another direction, which would you choose from the two following options?

-           Polaris mounts all around, but no gimbal (FYI the room temp variation I see is <2?C most days)

-           Standard mirror mounts but a gimbal at that conjugate plane

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil

Hi Tim

Correct. This must be a gimbal mirror mount. Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2 of [Huisken, Jan, and Didier Y R Stainier. 2007. "Even Fluorescence Excitation by Multidirectional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (mSPIM)." Optics Letters 32 (17): 2608-10.]

Thanks folks, I got it.  It's a GM100 ?1" gimbal mirror mount, for adjusting the mirror without changing the axis of rotation.  I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike - lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

Hello,

Please forgive the super-basic question.  In most diagrams on openspim.org<http://openspim.org> the last mirror housing before the sample chamber is another POLARIS, but in more advanced designs the mirror housing is a larger and unique item not specified in the basic build list.  Can someone let me know what that is?  Many thanks and apologies if this is answered somewhere else,

Message-ID: <D20C63BF.53A7%tnf8@pitt.edu>

Hello all,

Has anyone found a convenient solution for transmitted light illumination that can be controlled Micro-Manager? On the one hand you can use a handheld flashlight (torch), which works but is not something you can program.  On the other hand you have collimated light sources from e.g. Thorlabs.  Those do the job but they seem excessively powerful and expensive for what should be a pretty basic task.  I went searching for cheap USB-powered lamps that can be controlled through a software interface rather than a physical switch but those seem strangely hard to find.  As it stands I might put a DIY LED bulb in a cheap 'collimator' like the one below and link it to uManager through an arduino.

http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/38/V02-1702EN-107315.pdf

Even so I feel like I must have missed a simpler option.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks and all the best,


Tim

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Data Registration Failure
Message-ID: <tencent_5648661F582935EA7FBA45F4@qq.com>

Hi, ALL!
  I bulit my OpenSPIM last week, and I began to require data of zebrafish. But the data was registration failed.  The log of fiji was at the last of this mail. I try to change the threshold and nothing went well. 
  I wonder it's maybe something worry with my require processing,  so I descirbe my require processing below. 
  First, I selected a view, then set the Stack-Z = 400, and the step=7.5um, angle=-55.8.
  Second, I wanted to select another view, so I changed the angle to -19.8. But at the same time, I had to change the x-value to keep the the zebrafish in the view of camera. Of cause, the range of Stack-z was also changed. Was this step wrong? I should not change the x-value?
   Third, I repeated the second step to choose another three views and began to require data.
   I hope to get your help！


   By the way, I found the OpenSPIM.app(20150427) can not do data processing. When I did registration, the program alerted that missing 3D Viewer. I try to download the 3D Viewer, and it could work in this compter. Then I copyed the app folder to another computer, it couldn't work again. Was the 3D Viewer not installed in the app folder?  PS. The computer in lab can not access to Internet.
    Thank you！


Best ALL！

My response isn't really simple but...

I set up oblique illumination and a camera to aid in sample position after occluding the views of the sample chamber with heating and perfusion lines-and a sore neck from constantly checking the chamber during positioning.  It has worked great for positioning zebrafish to organoids.  Right now the illumination is from an old RGB LED board I designed being driven with PWM from a TLC5940 on an Arduino.  The Arduino is also driving an RGB screen for control.  The firmware for the Arduino could be adapted to use a customized version of the Arduino  micromanager driver-haven't gotten to it yet.  For that matter, I'd like the camera feed to be fed to micromanager too.  That's all too much development for me right now though.  I do have an extra RGB board that is populated and could probably dig up a version of the TLC5940 board that is unpopulated(I might have the parts squirreled away) if you're interested-firmwares too of course.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] transmitted light

Hello all,

Has anyone found a convenient solution for transmitted light illumination that can be controlled Micro-Manager? On the one hand you can use a handheld flashlight (torch), which works but is not something you can program.  On the other hand you have collimated light sources from e.g. Thorlabs.  Those do the job but they seem excessively powerful and expensive for what should be a pretty basic task.  I went searching for cheap USB-powered lamps that can be controlled through a software interface rather than a physical switch but those seem strangely hard to find.  As it stands I might put a DIY LED bulb in a cheap 'collimator' like the one below and link it to uManager through an arduino.

http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/38/V02-1702EN-107315.pdf

Even so I feel like I must have missed a simpler option.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks and all the best,

Hi Tim and others,

We use ScopeLED G180 Series RGB LED light source, a fiber light guide and a basic collimator for transmitted light illumination. It is a convenient solution, but not very cheap. The light source can be controlled directly by µManager (color, intensity and shutter), and if you use µManager multidimensional acquisition (MDA) and channels tools, the bright field imaging can be automatically integrated to time lapse, z-stacking etc. fluorescence experiments. However, on-off cycling and intensity modulation responses seem to have some delay when the device is controlled via USB. Typically it doesn't matter, but it can be a problem if BF and fluorescence channels have to be imaged in a rapid sequence, e.g. in fast time lapse experiments.

RGB color modulation is a nice "extra" feature, since a user can select an appropriate BF illumination color depending on the band pass wavelength of the used emission filter, and use a very little amount of narrow bandwidth light for TL imaging.

Hi everyone,

We've started to build a dual illumination OpenSPIM scope in Newcastle, Australia and our parts are mostly here. Our workstation has just arrived and it's come preinstalled with Windows 8. Before I start putting the software and drivers on, has anyone had any compatibility issues with the OpenSPIM software and this operating system? Would it be wise to step back to Windows 7?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

The main issue with Windows version compatibility is when drivers are 
not quite yet supported. Typically you will find all information 
regarding that on this page:

Dear OpenSpim community members,

I am proud to announce the version 0.1 “rubber” release of the mu-spim 
<http://mu-spim.xyz/mu_spim_rubber.html>.

It is the first prototype of a light-sheet microscope for smartphones. 
It is still very rough and DIY-ish, but implements the bases of 
light-sheet microscopy.

The design is largely inspired by the SPIM Corinne Lorenzo, Valérie 
Lobjois, Amina Maandhui and I developed in Toulouse in 2008 - 2010 (this 
one 
<http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/z-outils/images/site/recherche/publis/2010/article-ducommun.jpg>). 
It benefits from the support and partnership of the IP3D team at ITAV 
<http://www.itav-recherche.fr/index.php/fr/menu-itavequipeip3d>.

This project seeks to:

  *

    Popularize microscopy and create vectors for scientists/public
    exchanges, e.g. through the exchange of biologic samples to be
    imaged (see the PrakashLab’s foldscope <http://foldscope.com>). The
    reception so far with lay people is quite positive. I think there
    are many educational opportunities opened, particularly in
    inter-disciplinary settings.

  *

    Create a *compact, field ready, 3D microscope* (on those aspects,
    I’d be happy to ear from tech companies).

    It is for now a *fully open project* (CC-BY-SA-NC), and I am looking
    for any kind of collaboration that could make it progress. This
    early release is a way to find such collaborations.

You can browse the project (openscad based) on github 
<http://github.com/damCB/mu_spim> (getting a github account is painless 
and not intrusive. It is also a very efficient collaboration platform).

Feel free to pass this message along to anyone who might be interested.

Best,

Guillaume

Hi everyone,

We've got an openspim almost ready to work here in France. We are just 
concerned by the not-very-circular laser beam. Did somebody used a 
pinhole to clean up the beam ? What would be the best location for a 
pinhole in this setup : in the first or the second telescope ? And what 
should be its diameter ? (sorry for the basic questions, not an optical

Dear Zheng,

This could mean several things, for example that you do not have enough beads around the sample, do not segment them properly or that your views overlap only minimally and thus do not share enough beads. Another reason might be that you did not enter correct calibration, i.e. the ratio between xy and z dimensions. If that is the case the registration cannot work.

I recommend to read the paper about bead based registration and the documentation on the Fiji wiki [1] to understand what the algorithm is doing and what these reported numbers mean. These are not error messages, they are meant to help you understand where lies the problem in your registration. 

All the best

Dear PAvel，
    Thanks for your reply! I will go to read the documentation as you recommended.
    The xy resolution is just as described in http://openspim.org/Pixel_Size_Calibration (I have done the calibration with rule mode), and the z resolution is just the number of z-step when acquire the data. Is that all right?
    I have antoher question. As in the sample data, there are 0-4 angles for each time lapses. If I want to acquire multi-views for different angles, does only the rotional stage be moved when I change to another view?  The reason for I ask this question is that the detected part of sample would leave the view of CMOS when I just changed the angle stage, and I have to change the x or y stage to move it back. I don't know whether this process lead to the registration fail.


   Thank you for your reply again!

    Can someone tell me some possible reasons whick would lead to these errors? Both in the data process and experiment.

If I want to acquire multi-views for different angles, does only the rotional stage be moved when I change to another view?  The reason for I ask this question is that the detected part of sample would leave the view of CMOS when I just changed the angle stage, and I have to change the x or y stage to move it back. I don't know whether this process lead to the registration fail.

Each view has to be fully defined by positioning the sample using the xyz motors and defining the first slice, step size and number of slices. The system will try re-visiting these exact locations. If you would just move the rotational stage the sample would most likely disappear from the field of view as it is not centred on the rotation axis and that axis is anyway undefined with our simple sample holder.

Hi folks,

Thanks to the indispensable help of many users here, our SPIM is up and working.  You are all the best.

Since a SPIM makes it quite hard to change objectives, I bought 1x and a 0.5x C-mount camera adapters to get the equivalent of a 20x and a 10x objective.  It seems to work quite well.  Now I wonder whether anyone has tried a magnifying tube lens like the Olympus U-CA or U-ECA to get a higher power image.  It all depends on whether a 'vanilla' openSPIM design is already imaging near the Nyquist limit.  We get 0.33 um/px using the Olympus 20x/0.5 and a Hamamatsu Flash4.0 v2, and even with deconvolution it may be pointless to magnify the image any further.  Any thoughts appreciated.

Alternatively, has anyone tried keeping a second sample chamber with a higher power objective to swap in as needed?  It seems like a pain but less cumbersome than building a second instrument.

Thanks,


Tim

Hello Timothy,

We use the U-CA to much success... Aligning the light sheet for each mag is highly recommended. I've even use the 0.5x C-mount with it, but that doesn't work with large chip detectors. Another minor issue I have with it is it's range, it only doubles the mag over 4 slots (Empty, 1.25x, 1.6x, & 2.0x).

Pete

Hi,

We are using a Olympus magnifier 1x,2x and 4x with c-mount together with a Flash4.0 v2 and it works very well with the SPIM setup (20x 0.5 objective).

Thank you Fredrik and Peter!  Right now I am looking at either an Olympus U-AEC 1x/2x magnification changer or else the DE20BXC 2x magnifying camera adapter from SPOT Imaging.

I checked the Nyquist sampling frequency for deconvolution at www.svi.nl/NyquistCalculator, and it looks like magnification is a good idea.  The optimal sampling frequency for widefield with a 0.5 NA water lens is 0.26 um per px.  I am imaging at 0.33 um/px with a 1x camera adapter.  Therefore I have a little resolution to gain, though a 2x adapter at 0.16 um/px will be grossly oversampling.  It might be a good idea to use a 1.5x adapter instead, as 0.22 um/px is pretty close to the theoretical limit.  As I understand it SPIM improves the axial resolution of images but does not change lateral resolution relative to widefield.  Is this correct?

All the best,

No worries,

"As I understand it SPIM improves the axial resolution of images but does not change lateral resolution relative to widefield.  Is this correct?” Correct. It is in essence a widefield microscope system with optical sectioning in the axial direction.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] pinhole location and diameter to clean up the laser
 beam

I currently use a low-budget laser diode with terrible beam profile, so  
I'm forced to use a pinhole, but in fact I have a third telescope for  
that, before the entire setup. But I suppose you can try the first  
telescope. In the second telescope, which is after the cylindrical lens,  
the beam has the shape of a line, not a point, so that won't work. The  
size should be calculated dependent on your laser. Describing how to do it  
is slightly too long for an email, but by googling "beam cleaning pinhole  
size" I found for instance this:
http://www.academia.edu/5558409/Laser_beam_cleaning_Spatial_filtering_of_laser_beam_

However, if you do this you'll have a circular beam in the middle and  
diffraction rings around it, like here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk
so you get rid of one problem and introduce another. I suppose you'd have  
to characterize the light-sheet with and without the pinhole to see if it  
helps.

This is from me, maybe somebody has more to add or correct me if I'm wrong.

Regards,
Monika

Hi Jan, I hope the science is treating you well.

Could I ask about the gimbal vs. the 3-axis adjuster.  How much work is it to remove the tilt using the 3-axis version?  I assume you can achieve a pseudo-gimbal by adjusting a little on two screws at a time...?

Or maybe, to come at the question from another direction, which would you choose from the two following options?

-           Polaris mounts all around, but no gimbal (FYI the room temp variation I see is <2°C most days)

-           Standard mirror mounts but a gimbal at that conjugate plane

Thanks in advance for your time.
Neil

Hi Tim

Correct. This must be a gimbal mirror mount. Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2 of [Huisken, Jan, and Didier Y R Stainier. 2007. "Even Fluorescence Excitation by Multidirectional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (mSPIM)." Optics Letters 32 (17): 2608-10.]

Thanks folks, I got it.  It's a GM100 Ø1" gimbal mirror mount, for adjusting the mirror without changing the axis of rotation.  I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike - lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

All the best,

Subject: [OpenSPIM] ID'ing a part

Hello,

Please forgive the super-basic question.  In most diagrams on openspim.org<http://openspim.org> the last mirror housing before the sample chamber is another POLARIS, but in more advanced designs the mirror housing is a larger and unique item not specified in the basic build list.  Can someone let me know what that is?  Many thanks and apologies if this is answered somewhere else,
