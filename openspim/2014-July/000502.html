<PRE>Hi,
I'm still having trouble with the anti-drift function, and I'm not sure how
to proceed.  To explain the trouble, I made the following test: I set up a
5-time point acquisition with only one view, turned on the anti-drift, and
made a manual correction to first one, then made no more adjustments after
that.  The frames are 100 seconds apart, so no significant actual drift
should be occurring.
If I make a correction to Y or Z, I get the result I expect; the image
moves the right distance, in the right direction, and then doesn't move
again in the last 3 frames. But if I make a correction in X, the stage
moves to the correct position, but then on the following frame moves 2x the
previous distance, and then next time moves 2x the previous one again,
until it leaves the field of view.  The attached image shows z-projections
of subsequent frames, with red being the first one, green the second, and
blue is third frame.  If I correct to the left instead of right, the embryo
continues off to the left instead.  Setting the stage or the camera to
&quot;transpose mirror X&quot; in the tools/property browser changes whether the live
view mouse control behaves correctly, but doesn't alter this behavior.
A sample log file showing the anti-drift corrections:
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {8.6508; 0; 0}  (this x correction is the one I have
put in)
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {16.46055; -0.2493; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {34.48305; 0.2403; 0}
TP 0 view 0: Offset: {69.08625; -1.08135; 0}

It seems like there is a sign error of some kind, but I can't figure out a
way to change my configuration to correct it.  I have already switched the
X and Y serial numbers in my configuration file, which improved things a
little (previously this test resulted in the embryo traveling in circles).
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Aurelia
