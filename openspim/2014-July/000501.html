<PRE>Hi Luke,
Right!  I've never actually had the 'mouse moves stage' function working,
but thought it wasn't a big problem and used the stage controls tab
instead.  I have just found the 'Mouse moves stage' item that needs to be
clicked in the Tools menu, which I hadn't seen before, and did have to
transpose X and Y in my camera properties to get it to behave correctly.  I
think the X and Y transposition probably explains the interesting
&quot;spiraling out of the frame&quot; behavior I was seeing!  I'll try a timelapse
now and see if it works better. Thank you!
Aurelia

</I>&gt;<i> missing/defaulted to 1... Could you possibly verify your pixel size
</I>&gt;<i> setting, using Micro-Manager's 'mouse moves stage' feature? Try to drag a
</I>&gt;<i> particular structure around in the view, making sure it follows the mouse
</I>&gt;<i> pointer closely across the entire field of view. (You might need to flip
</I>&gt;<i> the camera's view using properties in the Property Browser, if the stage is
</I>&gt;<i> moving in the wrong direction.) I suggest this particular test since, at
</I>&gt;<i> its basic level, this is precisely what anti-drift does: move particular
</I>&gt;<i> features around to 'keep' their positions. Please also make sure that the
</I>&gt;<i> pixel size you set is still in use after starting the OpenSPIM plugin, and
</I>&gt;<i> that your configuration is saved with the correct pixel size set.
</I>&gt;<i> (Importantly, also make sure that the property criteria set for your pixel
</I>&gt;<i> size are being fulfilled by your setup -- usually the only property I
</I>&gt;<i> specify is &quot;Core-Initialize&quot; must be &quot;1&quot;.) One final idea is to try
</I>&gt;<i> over-setting the pixel size slightly; this should reduce the offset size of
</I>&gt;<i> the anti-drift somewhat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Barring this most likely possibility, the problem could also be something
</I>&gt;<i> physical -- a motor snagging on its track or something like that,
</I>&gt;<i> distorting the plugin's perception of position or interfering with the
</I>&gt;<i> stage's ability to adjust its position. Alternatively, depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> nature of the sample, the phase correlation may be having trouble
</I>&gt;<i> automatically determining the offset (looking through the diffs directory
</I>&gt;<i> might help). Another source of information may be the 'log.txt' file in the
</I>&gt;<i> acquisition directory (though it is only made in the output directory of
</I>&gt;<i> the first acquisition each time after the software is started);
</I>&gt;<i> historically the plugin has logged the offsets applied to each view to that
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course, if you're okay with not getting any sleep, you CAN manually
</I>&gt;<i> intercede at each timepoint. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry I can't immediately be of more help; ruling out pixel size
</I>&gt;<i> leaves many equally unlikely explanations that are more difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> verify. If you find the problem, or need more help, please feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> write the list again; I'll see what I can do. Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Luke
