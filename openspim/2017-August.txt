Hi,

Did anybody ever used a chamber filled with fluorescent solution (e.g.
fluorescein) to align the light sheet? Got a request from another group who
planned to use such method to align detection vs illumination objectives?

Any ideas welcome,

Emmanuel

Yes, I did, it worked nicely with fluorescein, for finding the beam waist
in the field of view, and checking the XY tilt.

Emmanuel,

I use both a fluorophore in the bath and beads in agarose. I find the
approximate focal point and in plane tilt of the beam/sheet with the bath.
For sheet tilt out of the detection focal plane, and setting cylindrical
lens rotation angle, I use free floating beads in the bath or beads held in
an agarose plug. Beads can be quite a problem to get out of the bath,
though this may not impact some imaging sessions, so I use an agarose plug.
I accept that lensing occurs when shooting through the agarose cylinder so
I shoot through the centre as best I can.

I tend to use Alexa dyes in the bath as I think the dyes are less likely to
get taken up into cells. TetraSpeck beads are great for fine aligning
second or third lasers to the alignment laser.

Cheers,

- David
