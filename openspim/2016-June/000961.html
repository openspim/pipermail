<PRE>Hi Mel,

that&#8217;s a long list of requirements. Here are some thoughts:

- test your samples on existing light sheet setups
- also test/consider a diSPIM-like configuration
- 2-Photon is beyond reach for $100k - and hard to do for 3-4 channels
- a fiber-coupled laser launch with 4 lines will be expensive - you might want to start with less lines and upgrade later
- a feasible detection combination would be a single sCMOS camera plus a filter wheel

Best,
Michael

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello OpenSPIM,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been following this list and reading papers in the field for about 
</I>&gt;<i> a year. In our lab, we've come to a point where we need to carry out 
</I>&gt;<i> long term fast nontoxic imaging of cell cultures that is only possible 
</I>&gt;<i> with SPIM, and have just obtained funding to build our own microscope to 
</I>&gt;<i> do these experiments. I was hoping to pick the brains of this mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list to hopefully design an appropriate setup, perhaps based on the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSPIM platform, so that we can carry out these experiments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In general, the experiment involves imaging HIV-infected T cells 
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel as they migrate through the ECM and 
</I>&gt;<i> spread the infection to other cells and do various other things related 
</I>&gt;<i> to the infection, e.g. bystander cell killing. Here are some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> considerations:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We have fluorescently-tagged viruses in the FITC channel, a live cell 
</I>&gt;<i> apoptosis sensor in the iRFP channel, and will also need to somehow 
</I>&gt;<i> label nuclei and perhaps also membranes. That would be a maximum of 4 
</I>&gt;<i> channels, with 3 channels being &quot;acceptable&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The cells will need to be imaged for 2 to 3 days, with a time 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution on the order of 2 Hz (for the full volume). T cells migrate 
</I>&gt;<i> at about 15 &#956;m/sec, and we would like sufficient time resolution to 
</I>&gt;<i> capture each cell at least twice during each body length movement (body 
</I>&gt;<i> length is about 10 &#956;m, hence needing around 2 Hz).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The entire volume (or close to that) of the hydrogel will need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> imaged at each timepoint. The volume of the hydrogel is up to our 
</I>&gt;<i> discretion, but generally it is on the order of 150 to 300 &#956;L.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Spatial resolution is not of particular concern, as we are more 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the cells as whole entities rather than e.g. the details 
</I>&gt;<i> of virus assembly in each cell. However, we would like comparable 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution in all three dimensions, as there is no real &quot;plane&quot; we are 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in and the cells can go in any direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. The hydrogel can be fairly optically dense, and we experience 
</I>&gt;<i> prohibitive distortion at anything deeper than ~100 &#956;m with widefield 
</I>&gt;<i> single photon imaging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Of course, temperature control and media perfusion will be required. 
</I>&gt;<i> Given the nature of the pathogen, we will need to be able to fully 
</I>&gt;<i> decontaminate the sample chamber and anything that has come into contact 
</I>&gt;<i> with the media. We've been looking at Ernst Stelzer's TC-LSFM to get 
</I>&gt;<i> ideas for the tissue culture chamber. We have access to a fabrication 
</I>&gt;<i> service at our institute that can help us design and build the chamber.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just to give you a general idea, we have about $100K available to us to 
</I>&gt;<i> purchase parts for this, not including the fabrication fee for the 
</I>&gt;<i> culture chamber for which we have other money set aside.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other than general ideas of what direction we should be heading in, or 
</I>&gt;<i> links to papers for setups we could emulate, I also have some more 
</I>&gt;<i> specific questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A. Would two-photon imaging be an inevitable requirement given the 
</I>&gt;<i> density of the sample?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> B. If the sort of speed of acquisition we are looking for is beyond 
</I>&gt;<i> reach for any system we could feasibly build ourselves (especially given 
</I>&gt;<i> the need for exposing in multiple fluorescence channels at each 
</I>&gt;<i> position), what should we sacrifice in our experimental plan to make it 
</I>&gt;<i> more within reach?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C. Does anyone know of any labs in the Northeast US/Quebec that have 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented a similar setup that we could go see in person? We are based 
</I>&gt;<i> in Vermont.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate the work everyone on this list puts in for newcomers, so 
</I>&gt;<i> thank you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Mel
