<PRE>Hi PAvel and Pete (and all),

Johannes has mentioned that he prefers the speed of BitTorrent Sync to other methods (including Dropbox, FTP, and so forth). Since I'm inclined to agree with that decision, I've put one of our data sets in the BTS folder. If you follow the setup instructions from BitTorrent Labs and use the secret Johannes emailed to you a little while back (search your inbox for &quot;BitTorrent&quot;), you'll be able to download the files from our computer here. Please let me know what you think of the data.


In the new directory you made for BTS, once you're finished synchronizing (this could take some time), you'll see a directory called Madison-SPIM-Data. Immediately within is one of our data sets using red beads, laser power of 5 mW and exposure time of 250 ms. Also, inside the subdirectory '1', I've put the image I fused from a different data set (10 mW @ 100 ms -- I didn't have time to share that one yet; if you're hoping to reproduce the fusion, let me know and I'll get it shared). Interesting to note is that the bottom-left is surprisingly blurry; along with some evidence from a data acquisition done yesterday, it seems to suggest I may need to re-calibrate our system soon.


Thanks again,
Luke
