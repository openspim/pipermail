<PRE>Hi Johannes &amp; Luke,
&gt;&gt;<i> I noticed that upon acquisition of a stack  written to disk, OpenSPIM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occasionally pauses in the middle of the acquisition for  some seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to several minutes. I have only observed this when the stack is written
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to disk, not when the same stack is left in RAM and opened immediately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried to turn ON/OFF the asynchronous writing option but that did not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change anything. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you running an anti-virus software that could be at fault?
</I>
Not that I am aware of, but there might be a lot of crap (updates, power manager, blablaâ€¦) that could interfere. I will see at cleaning this mess a bit.
However, I did not notice anything happening @ the GUI level and correlating with these hangs.

&gt;<i> I've been getting some weird hangings as each slice is written out (affecting the entire operating system, not just the SPIM software), but typically they were lasting no more than a half-second, and never on the order of minutes. They're recent, and I've been doing some timing tests to try and determine the cause to greater accuracy than 'when writing'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I take it the disk is local to the computer?
</I>
Yep, internal HD. 

&gt;&gt;<i> Also I have noticed that I can not increase the memory allocated to Fiji
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beyond 1024M as it causes the HamamatsuHam driver to not load properly. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is unfortunately not something we can fix until we switch to a
</I>&gt;<i> 64-bit version (which should be doable soon, given the hardware).
</I>
Let's wait then.

With my best regards,

Alexis
