<PRE>Hello Luke,

You are free to use any of the software that you can download from the
website.
The only software that is proprietary (not to be given or made available) is
the source code for our DLL (PiUsb.dll).
This DLL contains the intellectual property that we developed for using the
USB port to control our devices.
I do not believe we gave you this source code, but if we did, please do not
let anyone have it.
Otherwise, everything else is available, example code and all.
Is this acceptable?
Thanks

Picard Industries

Subject: Including OpenSPIM's PicardStage device adapter in Micro-Manager

Hi Jean,

We're getting to the point where we're ready to submit the device adapter
we've been writing to be included in Micro-Manager, and so I'm writing this
email to make sure it's alright that we include the PicardStage SDK (the
DLLs, libraries, and header files) in Micro-Manger's &quot;3rdpartypublic&quot;. For
reference, the files we'd like to include, along with the PicardStage device
adapter code we wrote, are no more than what is available for download
through your website.


If you have any objection, please do let us know!


Thanks,
Luke Stuyvenberg
