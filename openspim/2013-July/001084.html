<PRE>Hi Alexis,

&gt;<i> I noticed that upon acquisition of a stack written to disk, OpenSPIM occasionally pauses in the middle of the acquisition for some seconds to several minutes. I have only observed this when the stack is written to disk, not when the same stack is left in RAM and opened immediately. I tried to turn ON/OFF the asynchronous writing option but that did not change anything.

I've been getting some weird hangings as each slice is written out (affecting the entire operating system, not just the SPIM software), but typically they were lasting no more than a half-second, and never on the order of minutes. They're recent, and I've been doing some timing tests to try and determine the cause to greater accuracy than 'when writing'.


I take it the disk is local to the computer?
