Subject: [OpenSPIM] better 4D-Stages for openSPIM
Message-ID: <09b37a5b-a7f1-3849-e80d-c4d88925559d@brain.mpg.de>

Hi all,
I am really glad for my participation of the EMBO light sheet course 
this year. I learned really a lot. This knowledge now led to the point 
that we want to build our own light sheet microscope in our institute 
(MPI for Brain Research in Frankfurt).
We will begin with a simple openSPIM setup and put in more advanced 
things in the future. The reason why I am writing here is that the 
recommended 4D stage is not as good as we would like it to be. Does 
anybody know of good commercial 4D stages with a range of 1-2 cm or even 
more and a resolution as good as possible (>500nm)? Or would you 
recommend to build one on our own? I would be very thankful for any help.
Kind regards,
Florian

Dear Florian,

I spent quite some time on this issue when first building my setup. First,  
bad news:
-I haven't found any other ready-made 4D stage
-do I understand correctly that the OpenSPIM plugin only works with Picard?

But one can get a XYZ stage and then somehow add an arm for the sample and  
rotation, for example by using the R part of the Picard 4D if you already  
have it. And then, if you want to use uManager, pick something compatible  
with uManager. I recently abandoned my Picard and picked a XYZ stage by  
Standa - they have a good choice of ranges, I chose 25 mm from the 8MT173  
series. It works fine with uManager. I only have manual rotation right  
now, because I don't use multiview. Thorlabs also has a compact XYZ stage.  
All the other I found were much more expensive.

I hope this helps.

Monika

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Comparing SPIM data
Message-ID: <3c2b72c7-95e1-8cd9-c463-24ce9c31ebec@biologie.uni-muenchen.de>

Dear OpenSPIM community,

I was wondering if there is any chance to compare two SPIM datasets, 
both recorded from the same two angles, but of which one dataset could 
not be successfully registered and fused due to a bead distribution 
problem? Both datasets are subjected to cell tracking and the question 
is, if these cell tracks are comparable despite one dataset being fused, 
while the other one is not.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,

Christian
