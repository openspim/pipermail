Subject: [OpenSPIM] High background in the light sheet microscopy images
Message-ID: <808745243.10626583.1484185548098.JavaMail.zimbra@sjtu.edu.cn>

Hello, everyone.

I built a light sheet microscopy followed as the openSPIM.
But I got the images with high background as shown in the attachment.
The exposure time is 80ms.
The fluorescent beads, which are embedded in 6% PAGE gel, are in a cuvette.

Will anyone know the reason for such high background?
What can I do to reduce the background?

Thank you so much.

Best regards,
Yan

Hi Yan,



The beads in the left part of your image look suspicious, are you illuminating and/or detecting through the cuvette?



Best,

Michael

You're also saturating your image with your beads, feel free to reduce
the power/exposure time.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] variable PSF across light sheet
Message-ID: <op.yuc9cb2dahhlbl@pc507-99ff.ibd>

Hi all,

maybe somebody know a paper on dealing with variable PSF across the image,  
resulting from the changing light-sheet thickness (i.e. light sheet  
getting thicker further away from the centre)? For bigger samples, as the  
ones I image, keeping the light sheet thickness uniform would result in a  
very thick light sheet, so I was wondering if there is another method,  
given that PSF changes in a predictable way.

Best regards,

Hi,

Just had a quick question regarding the specs for the M3 screws used to
clamp together the base and the top pieces.
According to the design file, the the clearance holes are spec'd for M3
screws but the drawing specify a 2.4 mm clearance at the base.  Should that
be 3.0 mm or am I missing something?


Thanks
Donald

Message-ID: <CAGv7iOjmYpPUxc1bGnO-Pi56eORQ4q0o76=XEfOhtBK9vbcbAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Does anyone have any insight on the best materials to use for manufacturing
of the "self-made" parts? We were planning to make manufacture most of the
parts out of aluminum but will that cause reflection within the system
during acquisition? Additionally, can the sample chamber in the wiki be
made of aluminum as well or is acrylic a better option?

Thanks,
Kathleen Chen

Dear Kathleen,

You could ask for anodisation of these self-made parts in aluminium : 
many differents films exists to coat the aluminium in black to prevent 
reflections and protect the aluminium from agressive buffers.

Best regards,

Frédéric Brau

Subject: [OpenSPIM] real time projections, batch processing
Message-ID: <5323a90decc7cf83cae1477172d2d8a1@cam.ac.uk>

Dear OpenSPIMers,

I have two questions:

1. How can 3D projections be created in real time (does that mean during 
acquisition?) as it sais in Reynaud et al. (2014):

"Nowadays, plug-ins developed for the Fiji
platform15,16 allow for the transformation
of a massive time-lapse, multiview data set
into a dynamic 3D-rendered movie in real
time."


2. Where can I find informatin/documentation on how to use a cluster 
computer for registration/fusion/deconvolution?

The information I found seems to be obsolete: 
http://imagej.net/SPIM_Registration_on_cluster_(deprecated)

Many thanks for your time and input!

Best wishes,
Stephanie

Hi Stephanie,


Regarding your first question, you can use ClearVolume (http://imagej.net/ClearVolume). We originally had a version of the OpenSPIM acquisition plugin with ClearVolume directly integrated, but as ClearVolume is a Fiji plugin on its own now, we have to handle this in a different way. We’ll have an updated version of that ready soon(ish).


Regarding your second question, Christopher Schmied created an updated and automated version of the workflow. The guide is available at http://imagej.net/Automated_workflow_for_parallel_Multiview_Reconstruction, with source code on GitHub: https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/snakemake-workflows


I hope this is helpful for you!


cheers!


ulrik
