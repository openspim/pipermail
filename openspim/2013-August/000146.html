<PRE>Hi Alexis,

&gt;<i> I did some test and have good news: the new SPIMAcquisition.jar solves the
</I>&gt;<i> issue. The slices are now reliably written in the right order. I also have
</I>&gt;<i> the feeling it is a bit faster than the 'original/old' one and the metadata a
</I>&gt;<i> properly written.
</I>Excellent!

&gt;<i> -test2: same thing, but with the new SPIMAcquisition.jar. Everything is fine
</I>&gt;<i> (slices in the right order &amp; metadata present). I observed the async monitor:
</I>&gt;<i> it climbed to 27/240 (writing) then slowly decreased to 0/240 (Idle). Overall
</I>&gt;<i> it felt faster.
</I>My async monitor still rarely exceeds 1 before writing it out, though I've
noticed that sometimes it snowballs (i.e. if it doesn't get one written quickly
enough, they start to pile up until a break in the acquisition). Still, 27/240
gives lots of room, and that limit is pretty conservative. It's good to know
things are working properly now, and the associated speed boost is also a big
plus.

&gt;<i> I'll keep on using this version until the next update.
</I>If I don't get the update uploaded today, it will almost certainly be Monday. At
this point my biggest obstacle is deciding where to put the checkboxes to make
it show the monitor. ;-)

I should warn you in advance, though I'll try to make it clear when I announce
the update: the next update *will* obsolete the changes you made to the Cobalt
adapter. The reason is because it will be designed to work with the Cobalt
adapter in MM's nightly build -- I'm afraid you will need to revert your
changes.

Thanks again for experimenting, and for bringing this to light!

Luke

&gt;<i> Hi Luke,

</I>&gt;<i> I did some test and have good news: the new SPIMAcquisition.jar solves the

</I>&gt;<i> the feeling it is a bit faster than the 'original/old' one and the metadata a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can get the stacks and logs of my tests here:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did 3 acquisitions:
</I>&gt;<i> - test 1: A  stack of 40 slices (1024*1024)  with the original 
</I>&gt;<i> SPIMAcquisition.jar; the slices are mixed up. You will also notice in the
</I>&gt;<i> log.txt file the message &quot;Warning: asynchronous writer may have been
</I>&gt;<i> cancelled before completing. (0)&quot; I had that everytime the metadata are not
</I>&gt;<i> written. I did not hit &quot;abort&quot; at any time; after acquisition I simply waited
</I>&gt;<i> for the file to finish writing to disk (a couple of minutes)  and opened it
</I>&gt;<i> in Fiji (then the message appeared in the log).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -test2: same thing, but with the new SPIMAcquisition.jar. Everything is fine
</I>&gt;<i> (slices in the right order &amp; metadata present). I observed the async monitor:
</I>&gt;<i> it climbed to 27/240 (writing) then slowly decreased to 0/240 (Idle). Overall
</I>&gt;<i> it felt faster.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -test3: time lapse (5 time steps) of  a 40-slices stack; one stack every
</I>&gt;<i> 120sec. Absolutely no problems. The async monitor showed the same behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> as for test 2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll keep on using this version until the next update.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for your help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With my best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - First, it does some timing over the acquisition, outputting the results
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to the log; although it isn't very detailed, it gives a breakdown of how
</I>time
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is used while acquiring (for example, if the async isn't appropriately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; asynchronous, the acquisition time will be roughly the same as though it
</I>were
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; off).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Second, and more importantly for you, the async writer has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; completely revamped. It now queues the begin/end stack events as well as
</I>new
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; slices, so these operations shouldn't *ever* get out of order. It also puts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; up a monitor showing the state of its queue, which will let us know if it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; filling up or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you're willing to play guinea pig again, please try replacing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mmplugins/SPIMAcquisition.jar with the version from:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anyone is free to try this JAR out, but I haven't put it on our Fiji
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; update site for a few reasons -- the new features are only conditionally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; useful, and can't (yet) be disabled. That said, if the new async fixes your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; output problems, I'll polish these changes and incorporate them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Luke
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>
