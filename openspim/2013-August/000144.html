<PRE>Hi Luke,
thanks a lot! I'll test the new SPIMAcquisition and let you know. 
With my best regards,

Alexis

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. The source code for the linked plugin is available, but split up into two branches on github -- async-fix and profiling -- in case anyone is looking for it. At the moment, neither merges cleanly into the main branch, since I've just merged the new device manager code yesterday.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some more tests and hopefully some progresses. I scanned a 82Mb stack (1024*1024*41 @ 16bits)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - RAM usage by Fiji and stack writing to disk: 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ~20Mb used at start (out of 1Gb allocated) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as the scan progresses in ramps up to ~110Mb and then slowly decreases as the size of the file on disk increases; finally the garbage collector resets to 20Mb
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it takes up to 2 minutes to write the 84Mb and at least 1 minute more to write the remaining 2Mb (the metadata, I presume...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay; although the writing times are not at all ideal (my 400MB stacks were written synchronously and in their entirety in a little over a minute and a half), the RAM usage is more or less as expected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you open that stack &amp; metadata, you will see that the planes are not written in the right order. Look at the sequence (toward the end of the file above):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have some mixed feelings on this; this is the definitive proof I was looking for, but I'm genuinely at a loss as to how this may have come about. My best guess is that the synchronization is too loose, and somehow the acquisition (&quot;main&quot;) thread is writing slices (because it feels it needs to) before the writing thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have the feeling that my problems are somehow linked to Bio-Format	not behaving properly. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've tried the new Bio-Formats daily builds update site through the Fiji updater, and haven't noticed any problems from it; perhaps try enabling that update site and downloading the very latest versions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, I have most of the promised plugin updates. There are two main additions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - First, it does some timing over the acquisition, outputting the results to the log; although it isn't very detailed, it gives a breakdown of how time is used while acquiring (for example, if the async isn't appropriately asynchronous, the acquisition time will be roughly the same as though it were off).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Second, and more importantly for you, the async writer has been completely revamped. It now queues the begin/end stack events as well as new slices, so these operations shouldn't *ever* get out of order. It also puts up a monitor showing the state of its queue, which will let us know if it's filling up or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you're willing to play guinea pig again, please try replacing mmplugins/SPIMAcquisition.jar with the version from: <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone is free to try this JAR out, but I haven't put it on our Fiji update site for a few reasons -- the new features are only conditionally useful, and can't (yet) be disabled. That said, if the new async fixes your output problems, I'll polish these changes and incorporate them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Luke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
