<PRE>Hi Luke,

I did some test and have good news: the new SPIMAcquisition.jar solves the issue. The slices are now reliably written in the right order. I also have the feeling it is a bit faster than the 'original/old' one and the metadata a properly written. 

You can get the stacks and logs of my tests here: <A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/484859/2013-08-23.zip">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/484859/2013-08-23.zip</A>

I did 3 acquisitions:
- test 1: A  stack of 40 slices (1024*1024)  with the original  SPIMAcquisition.jar; the slices are mixed up. You will also notice in the log.txt file the message &quot;Warning: asynchronous writer may have been cancelled before completing. (0)&quot; I had that everytime the metadata are not written. I did not hit &quot;abort&quot; at any time; after acquisition I simply waited for the file to finish writing to disk (a couple of minutes)  and opened it in Fiji (then the message appeared in the log).

-test2: same thing, but with the new SPIMAcquisition.jar. Everything is fine (slices in the right order &amp; metadata present). I observed the async monitor: it climbed to 27/240 (writing) then slowly decreased to 0/240 (Idle). Overall it felt faster.

-test3: time lapse (5 time steps) of  a 40-slices stack; one stack every 120sec. Absolutely no problems. The async monitor showed the same behaviour as for test 2.    

I'll keep on using this version until the next update. 

Thanks a lot for your help.

With my best regards,

Alexis


&gt;&gt;<i> - First, it does some timing over the acquisition, outputting the results to the log; although it isn't very detailed, it gives a breakdown of how time is used while acquiring (for example, if the async isn't appropriately asynchronous, the acquisition time will be roughly the same as though it were off).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Second, and more importantly for you, the async writer has been completely revamped. It now queues the begin/end stack events as well as new slices, so these operations shouldn't *ever* get out of order. It also puts up a monitor showing the state of its queue, which will let us know if it's filling up or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you're willing to play guinea pig again, please try replacing mmplugins/SPIMAcquisition.jar with the version from: <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/SPIMAcquisition.jar</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone is free to try this JAR out, but I haven't put it on our Fiji update site for a few reasons -- the new features are only conditionally useful, and can't (yet) be disabled. That said, if the new async fixes your output problems, I'll polish these changes and incorporate them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Luke
