</I>Actually, what I meant was that from now on, the OpenSPIM plugin will try to
interact with the Cobolt device as though it were unchanged -- it will not
treat it as a shutter, and when altering laser power, it will attempt to set
the &quot;Power&quot; property, not &quot;PowerSetpoint&quot; (and so, having the property be named
&quot;PowerSetpoint&quot; even though the laser is a Cobolt will greatly confuse the
plugin). Essentially, the changes I'm making mean that the plugin will interact
with each device adapter differently.

By all means, though, commit your changes -- adapting the plugin to changes in
device adapters is very little work (which is the part of the point of this
update), so if your changes become 'canonical', I can easily change the
SPIMAcquisition plugin to support them.

I'm not planning to update the MM code base just yet -- as far as I am aware,
the nightly build's device adapters still work with the OpenSPIM version.

Thanks,
Luke
