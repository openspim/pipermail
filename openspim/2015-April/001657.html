&gt;<i> Question to Johannes: Do you want a pull request for that?
</I>
Whenever some code in OpenSPIM has been improved, or for that matter, in 
any Open Source software I maintain, I want a Pull Request. Otherwise 
the software would not improve but deteriorate, wouldn't it?

So was that a trick question?

&gt;<i> The issue I’m currently having is that it works just fine in Fiji with 
</I>&gt;<i> the MM
</I>&gt;<i> update site, but not with the latest MM nightly, as it brings an older
</I>&gt;<i> ome-xml version. Suggestions?
</I>
My suggestion is not new.

My suggestion is to finally work together on having *the same* software 
versions in all OpenSPIM setups, by using the update site. We already 
have a beautiful update site, but nobody took care so far to get it back 
up-to-date, right? So now everybody and her dog has to work just as hard 
as everybody else to get to a working state, and nobody benefits from 
anybody else's work (the Pull Requests that have been opened and merged 
have been a really nice exception).

I know that it is typically highly discouraged in scientific work to 
work with other groups: after all, you could write papers, and even 
scoop other groups, instead of working on something that benefits them 
as well as yourself, right? This, however, is not the idea behind 
OpenSPIM. The idea of OpenSPIM is that when everybody works a little, 
everybody benefits a *lot*.

So let's work everybody a little on the software. Preferably in a way 
that other people do not have to solve the same problem that you solved, 
*again*. Rather, in a way where each problem is solved such that nobody 
else has to bother with the same problem. Whether you share your 
solution as a mail to this list, as an edit to the wiki, as a Pull 
Request, just share it.

Then we all will benefit.

Ciao,
Johannes
