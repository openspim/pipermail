Hi all,

I was just reading the paper suggested by Jan in Aug (Weber, Michael, Michaela Mickoleit, and Jan Huisken. 2014. "Light Sheet Microscopy." Methods in Cell Biology 123: 193-215. doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00011-2.), thinking ahead to the calibration/alignment part of the setup.

Does anybody have part numbers and/or websites for the required pieces?  Also, I'd be interested in how you've positioned and held them at the objective focus, and ensured their correct orientation.

Thanks
Neil

Dear Neil,

hope you enjoyed reading the paper :). We use a home-made mirror/grid for aligning our setups. The "mirror/grid" part is cut from a stage micrometer:

Edmund Optics "Multi-Grid Standard Stage Micrometer"
http://www.edmundoptics.com/test-targets/image-analysis-test-targets/multi-grid-standard-stage-micrometer/2700/

Cutting the glass is tricky - maybe you have access to a workshop. You want to have both mirror and grid on top of each other on the same piece of glass, such that you just have to move the sample up and down to switch between them. One end of this piece of glass is then mounted in the tip of a 1 ml Braun Omnifix-F syringe using glue. That's the second difficult step. Ideally, the glass surface ends up straight in the rotation axis of your setup. Again, if you have access to a workshop, they might be able to help you with that. The syringe is then mounted in the sample holder. Make sure that the syringe has the right length for positioning the glass in the focal plane. One can also think of a machined or 3D-printed adapter (or entire holder) for the piece of glass.

Another tool that is really useful for alignment are fluorescent beads / microspheres in 1.5% agarose. This is especially good for the fine tuning of the light sheet position, PSF measurements and so on. Mirror/grid are more suitable for a coarse alignment.

Best,
Michael

Dear Neil!

We use a slightly simpler alignment scheme: I designed a mount for a simple 5x5x1mm? surface mirror that fits in our SPIM (see Fig. 6.12d on p. 94 in http://www.jkrieger.de/dissertation_final.pdf). If you hvae just a little bit of dirt on the mirror (e.g. by touching it and then cleaning it with a fine cloth, you can easily focus such a bit of dirt and then know where the sharp line on your mirror is. If you're interested, I can send you the design for the mirror mount, which is pretty simple to make for any mechanics workshop.

Also we have a simple plugin for a beadscan evaluation (PSF determination from z-stack) and to characterize a lightsheet in our SPIM-FCS/FCCS software:
http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/
or as a Matlab script:
https://github.com/jkriege2/B040_BeadScanEvaluation

Detailed instructions for this eval scheme will appear in a few weeks (I hope) in Nature Protocols in a (just-accepted) paper on imaging FCS/FCCS on a SPIM or TIRF. If you're interested, I can send you a preprint-version privately.

Best,
JAN

Regarding cutting that glass slide, I found the diamond wheel attachment on a Dremel tool to be indispensable for that. I was able to grind the slide fragment to a skinny trapezoid and wedge it into the opening of a 1 ml syringe without using glue.

Hi all,

We have started to use the SPIM system for calcium imaging and thus would like increase acquisition speed. What frame rates can be achieved with the OpenSPIM setup? What are the major limitations, considering software (micromanager) versus hardware (stage). I have noticed that the speed is ok in the beginning of a time laps exp but reduces over time (7-10 fps down to 3 fps). The system is has an Flash 4 so far from theoretical camera frame rates. I have a good workstation with +100 gb physical memory. I have increased the buffer memory in micromanager to 20 Gb (even tested with 50 Gb but no additional effect), writing data to a virtual harddrive generated in the physical memory, deselected xy and twister during acquisitions (noticed some effects) and uses short exposure times. Any other tips how to improve the speed.

Thanks again for a great project!

Hi Fredrik,

Are you imaging volumes or a fixed 2D plane?  If imaging a volume then I would be impressed with 3 FPS.  If you want to visualize a fixed plane, acquisition speed is simply the frame rate of your camera.  To optimize speed you should look into buying a CameraLink adapter card rather than using USB (does your computer have a USB 3.0 port and cable?).  You can speed it up right now by only using a sub-region of the sensor chip.  Click the 'ROI' button in uManager while viewing live and the camera will image a smaller area twice as fast.  Click the button without live view and it will give you an adjustable rectangle to choose how much of the sensor you want to use.  Only the number of vertical lines determine acquisition speed so the cropped area can be as wide as you want.

With a Flash 4.0 v2, CameraLink and ROI enabled we image a beating zebrafish larva heart at about 400 fps.  Naturally you need an acquisition time of 2 ms or so to do that, meaning more laser power.

Forgive me if you have tried all this already.

All the best,


Tim

One other thing - in theory you could be running against the write buffer or drive speed of your computer.  For high speed imaging it may be important to increase your RAM and use a SSD.

Thanks for your reply suggestions Tim. We are performing volume scans so I refer to fps as each xy-projection and in our case we have 10 of those in each volume. We are running with camera link option for theoretical 100 fps.

Hi Fredrik,

Are you imaging volumes or a fixed 2D plane?  If imaging a volume then I would be impressed with 3 FPS.  If you want to visualize a fixed plane, acquisition speed is simply the frame rate of your camera.  To optimize speed you should look into buying a CameraLink adapter card rather than using USB (does your computer have a USB 3.0 port and cable?).  You can speed it up right now by only using a sub-region of the sensor chip.  Click the 'ROI' button in uManager while viewing live and the camera will image a smaller area twice as fast.  Click the button without live view and it will give you an adjustable rectangle to choose how much of the sensor you want to use.  Only the number of vertical lines determine acquisition speed so the cropped area can be as wide as you want.

With a Flash 4.0 v2, CameraLink and ROI enabled we image a beating zebrafish larva heart at about 400 fps.  Naturally you need an acquisition time of 2 ms or so to do that, meaning more laser power.

Forgive me if you have tried all this already.

All the best,


Tim

Subject: [OpenSPIM] aquisition speed

Hi all,

We have started to use the SPIM system for calcium imaging and thus would like increase acquisition speed. What frame rates can be achieved with the OpenSPIM setup? What are the major limitations, considering software (micromanager) versus hardware (stage). I have noticed that the speed is ok in the beginning of a time laps exp but reduces over time (7-10 fps down to 3 fps). The system is has an Flash 4 so far from theoretical camera frame rates. I have a good workstation with +100 gb physical memory. I have increased the buffer memory in micromanager to 20 Gb (even tested with 50 Gb but no additional effect), writing data to a virtual harddrive generated in the physical memory, deselected xy and twister during acquisitions (noticed some effects) and uses short exposure times. Any other tips how to improve the speed.

Thanks again for a great project!

Regarding cutting that glass slide, I found the diamond wheel attachment on a Dremel tool to be indispensable for that. I was able to grind the slide fragment to a skinny trapezoid and wedge it into the opening of a 1 ml syringe without using glue.

Dear Neil,

hope you enjoyed reading the paper :). We use a home-made mirror/grid for aligning our setups. The "mirror/grid" part is cut from a stage micrometer:

Edmund Optics "Multi-Grid Standard Stage Micrometer"
http://www.edmundoptics.com/test-targets/image-analysis-test-targets/multi-grid-standard-stage-micrometer/2700/

Cutting the glass is tricky - maybe you have access to a workshop. You want to have both mirror and grid on top of each other on the same piece of glass, such that you just have to move the sample up and down to switch between them. One end of this piece of glass is then mounted in the tip of a 1 ml Braun Omnifix-F syringe using glue. That's the second difficult step. Ideally, the glass surface ends up straight in the rotation axis of your setup. Again, if you have access to a workshop, they might be able to help you with that. The syringe is then mounted in the sample holder. Make sure that the syringe has the right length for positioning the glass in the focal plane. One can also think of a machined or 3D-printed adapter (or entire holder) for the piece of glass.

Another tool that is really useful for alignment are fluorescent beads / microspheres in 1.5% agarose. This is especially good for the fine tuning of the light sheet position, PSF measurements and so on. Mirror/grid are more suitable for a coarse alignment.

Best,
Michael

Does anybody have part numbers and/or websites for the required pieces?  Also, I'd be interested in how you've positioned and held them at the objective focus, and ensured their correct orientation.

Hi Neil,

if you already have the 3-axis adjuster, then do not worry about it. I do not think it makes a big difference. I also do not think it is worth buying any fancy mounts that are especially temperature stable. If the mirror is easily accessible it anyway does not hurt to check the alignment before every experiment...

Hi Jan, thanks for your insight.

I haven't ordered my parts yet, and I'm leaning towards the gimbal for an additional reason.  As it's planned for a core facility I need to keep everything as covered as possible, and I think the two adjusters on the gimbal will stick through a custom cover quite nicely.  This is going on the assumption that this last mirror is used the vast majority of the time compared to the others.

Thanks and enjoy your weekends.

Neil

Message-ID: <E74D2D1E-0706-421A-BD23-C601F4D26E62@cores.utah.edu>

I just put together a cheap solution for a brightfield light for an openSPIM. It uses a 20 cent green diode, an arduino, a 10K potentiometer, 100 Ohm  esistor.  The arduino and light are powered by USB and are turned on and off by micro-manager and can be used as a brightfieqld channel in micromanager multi-dimensional acquisition window. The potentiometer and resistor determine the intensity of the light. The diode is fixed in place behind a collimating lens which fills the back aperture of a 10x immersion lens on axis with the sample and imaging lens.
 If your SPIM rig does not have a appropriate port and/or you do not have the 10x lens, one could focus the diode on the sample from above  at an oblique angle. This may require a brighter light, but would probably work with the diode I am using. Light level can be dialed in by using different resistors and potentiometers.
I attached photos of the setup and wiring.
If you have any questions don?t hesitate to email me.

cheers

I just put together a cheap solution for a brightfield light for an
openSPIM. It uses a 20 cent green diode, an arduino, a 10K potentiometer,
100 Ohm  esistor.  The arduino and light are powered by USB and are turned
on and off by micro-manager and can be used as a brightfieqld channel in
micromanager multi-dimensional acquisition window. The potentiometer and
resistor determine the intensity of the light. The diode is fixed in place
behind a collimating lens which fills the back aperture of a 10x immersion
lens on axis with the sample and imaging lens.   

 If your SPIM rig does not have a appropriate port and/or you do not have
the 10x lens, one could focus the diode on the sample from above  at an
oblique angle. This may require a brighter light, but would probably work
with the diode I am using. Light level can be dialed in by using different
resistors and potentiometers. 

I attached photos of the setup and wiring.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to email me.

Hi all, I hope the weekend has been good to you.

Does anybody know any details regarding the position of the back focal plane of the water dipping Olympus lenses.  I'm thinking about the design of my setup and wondered if anybody has those details for the 10X, 20X, and 40X water.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Hi everyone,

We're building a dual illumination OpenSPIM at the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle, Australia. Our aim is to have the scope and analysis pipeline used as a core facility for lab groups to image 3D tumour cell cultures, developing embryos and most importantly for us, optically cleared 3D tissue samples (e.g. CLARITY, CUBIC, 3DISCO, Scale etc.). Imaging cleared 3D samples would be an interesting avenue for OpenSPIM and it'd be great to hear about any hardware modifications or mounting protocols others may have used to do it.

If anyone wants to try clearing out their own tissue samples, my colleagues and I put together a handbook that describes the reagents, equipment and detailed protocols for 'Passive CLARITY'. We compiled the protocols outlined in Tomer et al. Nat. Prot. 9(7) 2014 and Yang et al. Cell (158) 2014 and added in our own refinements (after much trial and error!). It's a very simple technique and has worked really well in our hands. Here's the link. Download it to your desktop in case the link gets broken:

Hey Jamie,

I would have someone design the lenses (and therefor chamber as well) for you made in a way the is fluid/liquid proof WITHOUT using glue, also keeping in mind the absolute largest (NA in terms of detection lens, and) working distance possible so you could put in bigger tissues. I doubt that there is a objective on the market that would meet your requirements.

Hi Pete,

Thanks for the link. Some very impressive images from the mesolens. You?re
right that pickings are slim for commercially available lenses. Leica and
Olympus have some objectives that are suitable for various types of
cleared tissue, but come with hefty price tags. Apparently Zeiss have
something in the works as well (not that it?ll be cheap!). The RI range of
imaging media for different clearing techniques is obviously one of the
bigger challenges (e.g. 1.45 for Focusclear and 1.56 for DBE). Will look
into a custom design as you suggest.

Cheers
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

if you are using hazardous clearing media and don't have a dedicated dipping objective available, one idea would be to use long-working distance air objectives and a smaller, closed glass chamber. The main issue I would expect from such a combination would be a drift of your detection focal plane when moving the sample through the light sheet, because the light has to travel through layers of different refractive indices, and you change the "thickness" of those layers. But this drift should be linear and could be corrected by adapting the distance between light sheet and detection objective while acquiring a z-stack. So you would either need to motorize the mirror for translating the light sheet, or your detection objective, and then implement the drift correction in the software. Might be worth a try, unless I overlooked something important here.

Cheers,
Michael

Hi,

I am working on a SPIM microscope for cleared tissue. I plan to put it in  
Wiki at some point, but my boss wants to wait until the paper is written.  
Anyway, I use the approach of a closed chamber and an air objective. My  
chamber is 3D printed with windows made of microscope cover glasses - the  
"cost effective" approach :P. This only work for the non-corrosive media  
though. An alternative is a big glass cuvette. The RI of glass is already  
quite similar to the cleared tissue, so I don't think the windows are a  
big issue. Note that Deisseroth also has a cuvette in his design.

If you find a mounting medium that has the same RI as your sample, and you  
only move the sample while the chamber is stationary (same as in  
OpenSPIM), then you don't have drift, or at least not that much.  However.  
the air objective approach works for small NA, so it's best for small  
magnification - for me 4X/0.13 works nicely. Afterwards the aberrations  
will prevent you from achieving the resolution that you would have in air  
(there is a paper about it, Silvestri "Correcting spherical aberrations in  
confocal light sheet microscopy: A theoretical study"). It's a good way to  
start while collecting funds for a proper objective ;)

For mounting medium, the easiest and cheapest solution is to go the oil  
way, like in the CUBIC papers (Susaki et al, see in Methods/Imaging). The  
stuff that is used for confocal microscopy - FocusClear, sRIMS, Reagent 2,  
you name it - is usually too expensive, too unstable, or both (i.e.  
Reagent 2 for CUBIC tends to crystallize if your lab's air-conditioning is  
set too low, sRIMS also does something very weird).

If you have more specific questions, go ahead and ask. Greetings,
Monika

Hi Michael,

Nice idea. Especially motorising the corner mirrors as it would also make an ?autofocus? function during each z-step possible. Not just for the air/immersion fluid mismatch, but for RI inconsistencies throughout cleared samples as was done in ?CLARITY optimised light sheet microscopy? (COLM ? Tomer et al., Nat Protoc 9(7), 2014).

Luckily most of the immersion fluids for CLARITY are fairly innocuous, so the dipping objectives should be fine. Although I?m not sure how the dipping objectives would fare with the organic solvents used in techniques like BABB or 3DISCO?

Cheers
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

if you are using hazardous clearing media and don't have a dedicated dipping objective available, one idea would be to use long-working distance air objectives and a smaller, closed glass chamber. The main issue I would expect from such a combination would be a drift of your detection focal plane when moving the sample through the light sheet, because the light has to travel through layers of different refractive indices, and you change the "thickness" of those layers. But this drift should be linear and could be corrected by adapting the distance between light sheet and detection objective while acquiring a z-stack. So you would either need to motorize the mirror for translating the light sheet, or your detection objective, and then implement the drift correction in the software. Might be worth a try, unless I overlooked something important here.

Cheers,
Michael

Hey Jamie,

I would have someone design the lenses (and therefor chamber as well) for
you made in a way the is fluid/liquid proof WITHOUT using glue, also
keeping in mind the absolute largest (NA in terms of detection lens, and)
working distance possible so you could put in bigger tissues. I doubt

Hi everyone,

We?re building a dual illumination OpenSPIM at the Hunter Medical
Research Institute in Newcastle, Australia. Our ai m is to have the scope
and analysis pipeline used as a core facility for lab groups to image 3D
tumour cell cultures, developing embryos and most importantly for us,
optically cleared 3D tissue samples (e.g. CLARITY, CUBIC, 3DISCO, Scale
etc.). Imaging cleared 3D samples would be an interesting avenue for
OpenSPIM and it?d be great to hear about any hardware modifications or
mounting protocols others may have used to do it.

If anyone wants to try clearing out their own tissue samples, my
colleagues and I put together a handbook that describes the reagents,
equipment and detailed protocols for ?Passive CLARITY?. We compiled the
protocols outlined in Tomer et al. Nat. Prot. 9(7) 2014 and Yang et al.

Hi Peter & others,

it's a stupid question, but could you clarify how the magnifier is  
installed? In the basic design it is: detection objective-distance-tube  
lens-distance-camera. And with the magnifier? Is it used instead of the  
tube lens or additionally?

     Or has anyone tried to use matlab to display the data?

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Is there other software to display  the 3D-data,
	except BigDataViewer

Dear Zheng,

>      Hi, everyone. Sorry to disturb you. I use the BigdataViewer to display the SPIM-data-stack, but it seems that the bigdataViewer's display-mode is just showing only a slice of the 3D-data, not showing the data in a 3D mode(like the solidworks).

The BDV is a slice viewer. 3D rendering is in the works, but not yet ready for prime-time.

>      I want a software to show SPIM-data in a 3D-mode. If everyone have this kind of software, please recommend it to me.

One possibility i Fiji is the new ClearVolume plugin. 3D viewer also works, although probably not on the full resolution data. Other open source softwares that are good with 3D visualisation are Vaa3D and Icy.

In the commercial realm I would recommend Imaris or Arivis.

All the best

PAvel

Hi Peter & others,

it's a stupid question, but could you clarify how the magnifier is installed? In the basic design it is: detection objective-distance-tube lens-distance-camera. And with the magnifier? Is it used instead of the tube lens or additionally?

Regards,
Monika

Hi all,


I have just installed the FIJI package containing the OpenSPIM plugin and i'm getting an error when i press "Acquire SPIM image":

Error:

"Your setup appears to be invalid. Please make sure you have a camera and 4D stage set up.  You may need to restart Micro-Manager for the OpenSPIM plugin to detect a correct setup."


The devices i have added to micro-manager 1.4 and can control are as follows:

-Picard industries Twister (tested with its own software & have Z control in micro-manager through stage control)

-Sutter Lambda 10-3 filterwheel/shutter controller (one wheel & one shutter)

-Qimaging Retiga EX

-Cairn Research MonoLED (used as Vincent shutter D-1 device)


I have a single group "Channel" in Micro-Manager which changes the filter wheel position and all of the devices above work in micro-manager.  Does the SPIM plugin require all devices required for spim to be connected before it will launch?  I have a Vortran Stradus Versalase which has not yet been connected.


I have followed the SPIM FAQ and set the picard stage to "home" before using micro-manager.  I have also checked that all the dll's required for the devices listed above are within the OpenSPIM FIJI package.


Thanks for the help,


Matt

Message-ID: <DB5PR05MB1559F0D3CD2504EEA4BDBC57EC2F0@DB5PR05MB1559.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Open SPIM team

We're about halfway through our SPIM build project. What I'm hoping to do is make an OPT-SPIM. Getting the electronics sorted out for the SPIM side is proving a little tricky as our electronics guy has gone on a very long vacation. We can't get the interlock for our lasers installed which means it won't work at the moment.

However I believe that we can get the OPT side of the instrument going. To do this we'd need to get the BF light source, filterwheel and Picard stage going in Micromanager.

So far We have managed to get Micromanager to locate all of these devices. However we can't micromanager to run the Picard stage. The Open SPIM plugin is apparently looking for the lasers (which can't be connected right now). We wondered if we can persuade it either do without the laser or find an emulated laser somewhere.

We can send the core log if that's any help?

Thanks

Ann

Hi all,

I was just reading the paper suggested by Jan in Aug (Weber, Michael, Michaela Mickoleit, and Jan Huisken. 2014. "Light Sheet Microscopy." Methods in Cell Biology 123: 193-215. doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00011-2.), thinking ahead to the calibration/alignment part of the setup.

Does anybody have part numbers and/or websites for the required pieces?  Also, I'd be interested in how you've positioned and held them at the objective focus, and ensured their correct orientation.

Thanks

Dear Neil,

hope you enjoyed reading the paper :). We use a home-made mirror/grid for aligning our setups. The "mirror/grid" part is cut from a stage micrometer:

Edmund Optics "Multi-Grid Standard Stage Micrometer"
http://www.edmundoptics.com/test-targets/image-analysis-test-targets/multi-grid-standard-stage-micrometer/2700/

Cutting the glass is tricky - maybe you have access to a workshop. You want to have both mirror and grid on top of each other on the same piece of glass, such that you just have to move the sample up and down to switch between them. One end of this piece of glass is then mounted in the tip of a 1 ml Braun Omnifix-F syringe using glue. That's the second difficult step. Ideally, the glass surface ends up straight in the rotation axis of your setup. Again, if you have access to a workshop, they might be able to help you with that. The syringe is then mounted in the sample holder. Make sure that the syringe has the right length for positioning the glass in the focal plane. One can also think of a machined or 3D-printed adapter (or entire holder) for the piece of glass.

Another tool that is really useful for alignment are fluorescent beads / microspheres in 1.5% agarose. This is especially good for the fine tuning of the light sheet position, PSF measurements and so on. Mirror/grid are more suitable for a coarse alignment.

Best,
Michael

Dear Neil!

We use a slightly simpler alignment scheme: I designed a mount for a simple 5x5x1mm³ surface mirror that fits in our SPIM (see Fig. 6.12d on p. 94 in http://www.jkrieger.de/dissertation_final.pdf). If you hvae just a little bit of dirt on the mirror (e.g. by touching it and then cleaning it with a fine cloth, you can easily focus such a bit of dirt and then know where the sharp line on your mirror is. If you're interested, I can send you the design for the mirror mount, which is pretty simple to make for any mechanics workshop.

Also we have a simple plugin for a beadscan evaluation (PSF determination from z-stack) and to characterize a lightsheet in our SPIM-FCS/FCCS software:
http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/
or as a Matlab script:
https://github.com/jkriege2/B040_BeadScanEvaluation

Detailed instructions for this eval scheme will appear in a few weeks (I hope) in Nature Protocols in a (just-accepted) paper on imaging FCS/FCCS on a SPIM or TIRF. If you're interested, I can send you a preprint-version privately.

Best,
JAN

Regarding cutting that glass slide, I found the diamond wheel attachment on a Dremel tool to be indispensable for that. I was able to grind the slide fragment to a skinny trapezoid and wedge it into the opening of a 1 ml syringe without using glue.

Dear Neil,

hope you enjoyed reading the paper :). We use a home-made mirror/grid for aligning our setups. The "mirror/grid" part is cut from a stage micrometer:

Edmund Optics "Multi-Grid Standard Stage Micrometer"
http://www.edmundoptics.com/test-targets/image-analysis-test-targets/multi-grid-standard-stage-micrometer/2700/

Cutting the glass is tricky - maybe you have access to a workshop. You want to have both mirror and grid on top of each other on the same piece of glass, such that you just have to move the sample up and down to switch between them. One end of this piece of glass is then mounted in the tip of a 1 ml Braun Omnifix-F syringe using glue. That's the second difficult step. Ideally, the glass surface ends up straight in the rotation axis of your setup. Again, if you have access to a workshop, they might be able to help you with that. The syringe is then mounted in the sample holder. Make sure that the syringe has the right length for positioning the glass in the focal plane. One can also think of a machined or 3D-printed adapter (or entire holder) for the piece of glass.

Another tool that is really useful for alignment are fluorescent beads / microspheres in 1.5% agarose. This is especially good for the fine tuning of the light sheet position, PSF measurements and so on. Mirror/grid are more suitable for a coarse alignment.

Best,
Michael

Hi all,

I was just reading the paper suggested by Jan in Aug (Weber, Michael, Michaela Mickoleit, and Jan Huisken. 2014. "Light Sheet Microscopy." Methods in Cell Biology 123: 193-215. doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00011-2.), thinking ahead to the calibration/alignment part of the setup.

Does anybody have part numbers and/or websites for the required pieces?  Also, I'd be interested in how you've positioned and held them at the objective focus, and ensured their correct orientation.

Thanks

Hi all,

We have started to use the SPIM system for calcium imaging and thus would like increase acquisition speed. What frame rates can be achieved with the OpenSPIM setup? What are the major limitations, considering software (micromanager) versus hardware (stage). I have noticed that the speed is ok in the beginning of a time laps exp but reduces over time (7-10 fps down to 3 fps). The system is has an Flash 4 so far from theoretical camera frame rates. I have a good workstation with +100 gb physical memory. I have increased the buffer memory in micromanager to 20 Gb (even tested with 50 Gb but no additional effect), writing data to a virtual harddrive generated in the physical memory, deselected xy and twister during acquisitions (noticed some effects) and uses short exposure times. Any other tips how to improve the speed.

Thanks again for a great project!

Hi Fredrik,

Are you imaging volumes or a fixed 2D plane?  If imaging a volume then I would be impressed with 3 FPS.  If you want to visualize a fixed plane, acquisition speed is simply the frame rate of your camera.  To optimize speed you should look into buying a CameraLink adapter card rather than using USB (does your computer have a USB 3.0 port and cable?).  You can speed it up right now by only using a sub-region of the sensor chip.  Click the 'ROI' button in uManager while viewing live and the camera will image a smaller area twice as fast.  Click the button without live view and it will give you an adjustable rectangle to choose how much of the sensor you want to use.  Only the number of vertical lines determine acquisition speed so the cropped area can be as wide as you want.

With a Flash 4.0 v2, CameraLink and ROI enabled we image a beating zebrafish larva heart at about 400 fps.  Naturally you need an acquisition time of 2 ms or so to do that, meaning more laser power.

Forgive me if you have tried all this already.

All the best,


Tim

One other thing - in theory you could be running against the write buffer or drive speed of your computer.  For high speed imaging it may be important to increase your RAM and use a SSD.

Thanks for your reply suggestions Tim. We are performing volume scans so I refer to fps as each xy-projection and in our case we have 10 of those in each volume. We are running with camera link option for theoretical 100 fps.

Hi Neil,

if you already have the 3-axis adjuster, then do not worry about it. I do not think it makes a big difference. I also do not think it is worth buying any fancy mounts that are especially temperature stable. If the mirror is easily accessible it anyway does not hurt to check the alignment before every experiment...

Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike – lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

Hi Jan, thanks for your insight.

I haven't ordered my parts yet, and I'm leaning towards the gimbal for an additional reason.  As it's planned for a core facility I need to keep everything as covered as possible, and I think the two adjusters on the gimbal will stick through a custom cover quite nicely.  This is going on the assumption that this last mirror is used the vast majority of the time compared to the others.

Thanks and enjoy your weekends.

Neil

Hi Neil,

if you already have the 3-axis adjuster, then do not worry about it. I do not think it makes a big difference. I also do not think it is worth buying any fancy mounts that are especially temperature stable. If the mirror is easily accessible it anyway does not hurt to check the alignment before every experiment...

Hi Jan, I hope the science is treating you well.

Could I ask about the gimbal vs. the 3-axis adjuster.  How much work is it to remove the tilt using the 3-axis version?  I assume you can achieve a pseudo-gimbal by adjusting a little on two screws at a time...?

Or maybe, to come at the question from another direction, which would you choose from the two following options?
-           Polaris mounts all around, but no gimbal (FYI the room temp variation I see is <2°C most days)
-           Standard mirror mounts but a gimbal at that conjugate plane

Thanks in advance for your time.

Hi Tim

Correct. This must be a gimbal mirror mount. Sitting in the conjugate plane to the back focal plane you use this mirror to move the light sheet into the focal plane of your detection system (panel C below). If you used a regular (3-screw) mount you would not only translate the sheet but also introduce a tilt (panel D).

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2 of [Huisken, Jan, and Didier Y R Stainier. 2007. "Even Fluorescence Excitation by Multidirectional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (mSPIM)." Optics Letters 32 (17): 2608-10.]

Thanks folks, I got it.  It's a GM100 Ø1" gimbal mirror mount, for adjusting the mirror without changing the axis of rotation.  I can see how a POLARIS in that position can be a little like adjusting cantilever brakes on a bike - lots of axes of adjustment and changing one effects all the others.  Having something there that adjusts like 'V' brakes do (independent axes, less frustration) seems like a good idea.

All the best,

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Cheap Brightfield solution
Message-ID: <E74D2D1E-0706-421A-BD23-C601F4D26E62@cores.utah.edu>

I just put together a cheap solution for a brightfield light for an openSPIM. It uses a 20 cent green diode, an arduino, a 10K potentiometer, 100 Ohm  esistor.  The arduino and light are powered by USB and are turned on and off by micro-manager and can be used as a brightfieqld channel in micromanager multi-dimensional acquisition window. The potentiometer and resistor determine the intensity of the light. The diode is fixed in place behind a collimating lens which fills the back aperture of a 10x immersion lens on axis with the sample and imaging lens.
 If your SPIM rig does not have a appropriate port and/or you do not have the 10x lens, one could focus the diode on the sample from above  at an oblique angle. This may require a brighter light, but would probably work with the diode I am using. Light level can be dialed in by using different resistors and potentiometers.
I attached photos of the setup and wiring.
If you have any questions don’t hesitate to email me.

cheers

Hi all, I hope the weekend has been good to you.

Does anybody know any details regarding the position of the back focal plane of the water dipping Olympus lenses.  I'm thinking about the design of my setup and wondered if anybody has those details for the 10X, 20X, and 40X water.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Hi everyone,

We're building a dual illumination OpenSPIM at the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle, Australia. Our aim is to have the scope and analysis pipeline used as a core facility for lab groups to image 3D tumour cell cultures, developing embryos and most importantly for us, optically cleared 3D tissue samples (e.g. CLARITY, CUBIC, 3DISCO, Scale etc.). Imaging cleared 3D samples would be an interesting avenue for OpenSPIM and it'd be great to hear about any hardware modifications or mounting protocols others may have used to do it.

If anyone wants to try clearing out their own tissue samples, my colleagues and I put together a handbook that describes the reagents, equipment and detailed protocols for 'Passive CLARITY'. We compiled the protocols outlined in Tomer et al. Nat. Prot. 9(7) 2014 and Yang et al. Cell (158) 2014 and added in our own refinements (after much trial and error!). It's a very simple technique and has worked really well in our hands. Here's the link. Download it to your desktop in case the link gets broken:

I doubt that there is a objective on the market that would meet your requirements.

Hi Pete,

Thanks for the link. Some very impressive images from the mesolens. You¹re
right that pickings are slim for commercially available lenses. Leica and
Olympus have some objectives that are suitable for various types of
cleared tissue, but come with hefty price tags. Apparently Zeiss have
something in the works as well (not that it¹ll be cheap!). The RI range of
imaging media for different clearing techniques is obviously one of the
bigger challenges (e.g. 1.45 for Focusclear and 1.56 for DBE). Will look
into a custom design as you suggest.

Cheers
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

if you are using hazardous clearing media and don't have a dedicated dipping objective available, one idea would be to use long-working distance air objectives and a smaller, closed glass chamber. The main issue I would expect from such a combination would be a drift of your detection focal plane when moving the sample through the light sheet, because the light has to travel through layers of different refractive indices, and you change the "thickness" of those layers. But this drift should be linear and could be corrected by adapting the distance between light sheet and detection objective while acquiring a z-stack. So you would either need to motorize the mirror for translating the light sheet, or your detection objective, and then implement the drift correction in the software. Might be worth a try, unless I overlooked something important here.

Cheers,
Michael

Hi,

I am working on a SPIM microscope for cleared tissue. I plan to put it in  
Wiki at some point, but my boss wants to wait until the paper is written.  
Anyway, I use the approach of a closed chamber and an air objective. My  
chamber is 3D printed with windows made of microscope cover glasses - the  
"cost effective" approach :P. This only work for the non-corrosive media  
though. An alternative is a big glass cuvette. The RI of glass is already  
quite similar to the cleared tissue, so I don't think the windows are a  
big issue. Note that Deisseroth also has a cuvette in his design.

If you find a mounting medium that has the same RI as your sample, and you  
only move the sample while the chamber is stationary (same as in  
OpenSPIM), then you don't have drift, or at least not that much.  However.  
the air objective approach works for small NA, so it's best for small  
magnification - for me 4X/0.13 works nicely. Afterwards the aberrations  
will prevent you from achieving the resolution that you would have in air  
(there is a paper about it, Silvestri "Correcting spherical aberrations in  
confocal light sheet microscopy: A theoretical study"). It's a good way to  
start while collecting funds for a proper objective ;)

For mounting medium, the easiest and cheapest solution is to go the oil  
way, like in the CUBIC papers (Susaki et al, see in Methods/Imaging). The  
stuff that is used for confocal microscopy - FocusClear, sRIMS, Reagent 2,  
you name it - is usually too expensive, too unstable, or both (i.e.  
Reagent 2 for CUBIC tends to crystallize if your lab's air-conditioning is  
set too low, sRIMS also does something very weird).

If you have more specific questions, go ahead and ask. Greetings,
Monika

Hi Michael,

Nice idea. Especially motorising the corner mirrors as it would also make an ‘autofocus’ function during each z-step possible. Not just for the air/immersion fluid mismatch, but for RI inconsistencies throughout cleared samples as was done in ‘CLARITY optimised light sheet microscopy’ (COLM – Tomer et al., Nat Protoc 9(7), 2014).

Luckily most of the immersion fluids for CLARITY are fairly innocuous, so the dipping objectives should be fine. Although I’m not sure how the dipping objectives would fare with the organic solvents used in techniques like BABB or 3DISCO…

Cheers
Jamie

Hi everyone,

We¹re building a dual illumination OpenSPIM at the Hunter Medical
Research Institute in Newcastle, Australia. Our ai m is to have the scope
and analysis pipeline used as a core facility for lab groups to image 3D
tumour cell cultures, developing embryos and most importantly for us,
optically cleared 3D tissue samples (e.g. CLARITY, CUBIC, 3DISCO, Scale
etc.). Imaging cleared 3D samples would be an interesting avenue for
OpenSPIM and it¹d be great to hear about any hardware modifications or
mounting protocols others may have used to do it.

If anyone wants to try clearing out their own tissue samples, my
colleagues and I put together a handbook that describes the reagents,
equipment and detailed protocols for ŒPassive CLARITY¹. We compiled the
protocols outlined in Tomer et al. Nat. Prot. 9(7) 2014 and Yang et al.

Hi Michael, 

Nice idea. Especially motorising the corner mirrors as it would also make an ‘autofocus’ function during each z-step possible. Not just for the air/immersion fluid mismatch, but for RI inconsistencies throughout cleared samples as was done in ‘CLARITY optimised light sheet microsc opy’ (COLM – Tomer et al., Nat Protoc 9(7), 2014). 

Luckily most of the immersion fluids for CLARITY are fairly innocuous, so the dipping objectives should be fine. Although I’m not sure how the dipping objectives would fare with the organic solvents used in techniques like BABB or 3DISCO… 

Cheers 
Jamie

Hi Jamie, 

if you are using hazardous clearing media and don't have a dedicated dipping objective available, one idea would be to use long-working distance air objectives and a smaller, closed glass chamber. The main issue I would expect from such a combination would be a drift of your detection focal plane when moving the sample through the light sheet, because the light has to travel through layers of different refractive indices, and you change the "thickness" of those layers. But this drift should be linear and could be corrected by adapting the distance between light sheet and detection objective while acquiring a z-stack. So you would either need to motorize the mirror for translating the light sheet, or your detection objective, and then implement the drift correction in the software. Might be worth a try, unless I overlooked something important here. 

Cheers, 
Michael

Hi Pete, 

Thanks for the link. Some very impressive images from the mesolens. You¹re 
right that pickings are slim for commercially available lenses. Leica and 
Olympus have some objectives that are suitable for various types of 
cleared tissue, but come with hefty price tags. Apparently Zeiss have 
something in the works as well (not that it¹ll be cheap!). The RI range of 
imaging media for different clearing techniques is obviously one of the 
bigger challenges (e.g. 1.45 for Focusclear and 1.56 for DBE). Will look 
into a custom design as you suggest. 

Cheers 
Jamie

Hey Jamie, 

I would have someone design the lenses (and therefor chamber as well) for 
you made in a way the is fluid/liquid proof WITHOUT using glue, also 
keeping in mind the absolute largest (NA in terms of detection lens, and) 
working distance possible so you could put in bigger tissues. I doubt 
that there is a objective on the market that would meet your requirements.

Hi everyone, 

We¹re building a dual illumination OpenSPIM at the Hunter Medical 
Research Institute in Newcastle, Australia. Our ai m is to have the scope 
and analysis pipeline used as a core facility for lab groups to image 3D 
tumour cell cultures, developing embryos and most importantly for us, 
optically cleared 3D tissue samples (e.g. CLARITY, CUBIC, 3DISCO, Scale 
etc.). Imaging cleared 3D samples would be an interesting avenue for 
OpenSPIM and it¹d be great to hear about any hardware modifications or 
mounting protocols others may have used to do it. 

If anyone wants to try clearing out their own tissue samples, my 
colleagues and I put together a handbook that describes the reagents, 
equipment and detailed protocols for ŒPassive CLARITY¹. We compiled the 
protocols outlined in Tomer et al. Nat. Prot. 9(7) 2014 and Yang et al. 
Cell (158) 2014 and added in our own refinements (after much trial and 
error!). It¹s a very simple technique and has worked really well in our

Hi Peter & others,

it's a stupid question, but could you clarify how the magnifier is  
installed? In the basic design it is: detection objective-distance-tube  
lens-distance-camera. And with the magnifier? Is it used instead of the  
tube lens or additionally?

The BDV is a slice viewer. 3D rendering is in the works, but not yet ready for prime-time.

>      I want a software to show SPIM-data in a 3D-mode. If everyone have this kind of software, please recommend it to me.

One possibility i Fiji is the new ClearVolume plugin. 3D viewer also works, although probably not on the full resolution data. Other open source softwares that are good with 3D visualisation are Vaa3D and Icy.

In the commercial realm I would recommend Imaris or Arivis.

All the best

Hi all,


I have just installed the FIJI package containing the OpenSPIM plugin and i'm getting an error when i press "Acquire SPIM image":

Error:

"Your setup appears to be invalid. Please make sure you have a camera and 4D stage set up.  You may need to restart Micro-Manager for the OpenSPIM plugin to detect a correct setup."


The devices i have added to micro-manager 1.4 and can control are as follows:

-Picard industries Twister (tested with its own software & have Z control in micro-manager through stage control)

-Sutter Lambda 10-3 filterwheel/shutter controller (one wheel & one shutter)

-Qimaging Retiga EX

-Cairn Research MonoLED (used as Vincent shutter D-1 device)


I have a single group "Channel" in Micro-Manager which changes the filter wheel position and all of the devices above work in micro-manager.  Does the SPIM plugin require all devices required for spim to be connected before it will launch?  I have a Vortran Stradus Versalase which has not yet been connected.


I have followed the SPIM FAQ and set the picard stage to "home" before using micro-manager.  I have also checked that all the dll's required for the devices listed above are within the OpenSPIM FIJI package.


Thanks for the help,


Matt

Message-ID: <DB5PR05MB1559F0D3CD2504EEA4BDBC57EC2F0@DB5PR05MB1559.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Open SPIM team

We're about halfway through our SPIM build project. What I'm hoping to do is make an OPT-SPIM. Getting the electronics sorted out for the SPIM side is proving a little tricky as our electronics guy has gone on a very long vacation. We can't get the interlock for our lasers installed which means it won't work at the moment.

However I believe that we can get the OPT side of the instrument going. To do this we'd need to get the BF light source, filterwheel and Picard stage going in Micromanager.

So far We have managed to get Micromanager to locate all of these devices. However we can't micromanager to run the Picard stage. The Open SPIM plugin is apparently looking for the lasers (which can't be connected right now). We wondered if we can persuade it either do without the laser or find an emulated laser somewhere.

We can send the core log if that's any help?

Thanks
