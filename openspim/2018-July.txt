Subject: [OpenSPIM] Problems with Stage Mount
Message-ID: <8caa91d97c374e82bb5ee23f132de764@IN-CCI-D1S13.ads.iu.edu>

Hello Openspimmers,

I am brand new to SPIM and I recently inherited a home-built SPIM system based on OpenSPIM. The system has a Picard Industries USB 4D stage mount with the serial number 056. I discovered that, after setting my angles and positions in the MicroManager software, the stage mount does not return to its original position, which throws off all of the positions and angles I had set. Has anyone encountered this before? Is this a software or mechanical problem? How did you manage it? Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] sponge sample holder
Message-ID: <1531820873304.8091@iu.edu>

Can someone tell me where I can order one of these sponge sample holders? I've searched several companies and cannot find one or I'm using the wrong name for the part. The company and part # is not listed in the OpenSPIM website. Thank you.

Well you can make it yourself as it is the thickness of yoga mat or any
foam based material hanging around (packing material, eppendorf floating
raft.)
Make a nice template and then you are.
