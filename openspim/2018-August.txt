Subject: [OpenSPIM] OpenSPIM mailing list transition to forum.image.sc

Hello subscribers to the OpenSPIM mailing list!

The new Image.sc Forum has finally launched [1], and the OpenSPIM project
has signed on as a software partner.

As such, this openspim at openspim.org mailman list is being retired. From now
on, please post questions about OpenSPIM on the Image.sc Forum at
https://forum.image.sc using the openspim tag.

The forum.image.sc site is a unified and more visible discussion forum with
many experts in topics heavily overlapping with OpenSPIM's hardware and
software concerns.

The archives for the old list will continue to remain accessible at:

https://openspim.org/pipermail/openspim/

See you all on the forum!

Regards,
Curtis
