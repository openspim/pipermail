<PRE>Hi All,

Pavel and I were talking today, and we both talking about how to prepare for the increased&#160;activity&#160;once the paper goes out. To prepare for this, we have the following plan:


1) We are&#160;actively&#160;pursuing funding including a planned grant in September to help support software in particular (in addition to hardware). But in meantime LOCI's priority will be to support the configuration as listed on the openspim webpage, and fix any problems with that. Any support for new hardware will be limited and labs wanting to use new unsupported hardware should be aware of this priority and also be encourage to add support themselves. I will be in touch about the grant this summer but if any of you have wish lists for OpenSPIM development (hardware and software) please let me know. Pavel will be sending me his. 


2) Improved documentation for OpenSpim Analysis, Pavel will be adding a section to OpenSPIM.org before the paper comes out about how to do analysis. We will all help, in particular there is another LOCI scientist (Julie last) who is starting to use openspim for zebrafish imaging and she can help with the documentation.


3) Also this summer we will be doing a JOVE hardware paper with Pavel (with section on software) that will be filmed in Dresden. This will help complement the NM paper. Pavel plans on sending a first draft of this to all of us in July.


thanks everyone
best
kevin
