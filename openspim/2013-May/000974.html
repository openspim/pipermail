<PRE>Hi Luke,

thank you for taking on the task to address the UnsatisfiedLlinkErrors. I
will summarize a few points to keep everybody interested in the loop:

- since Microsoft does not allow redistribution of the debug libraries, we
  had to recompile everything in release mode

- there was a bug that would prevent release mode from working correctly:
  it still included debug information

- the old redistributable libraries (i.e. Visual Studio 2008's) required a
  manifest to be loaded (a small .xml file)

- some setting in Micro-Manager enforces compatibility with the old
  runtime libraries (as can be seen in
  MMCoreJ_wrap.dll.intermediate.manifest)

- we therefore need to ship

	- the old runtime libraries
	- the old runtime manifest
	- the new runtime
	- the manifest for MMCoreJ_wrap.dll

Now, in my tests on the VM (you have credentials to log in), I could start
Micro-Manager again, without getting thos unsatisfied links.

May I ask you to check a couple of things, still?

- I recompiled a debug.exe that also adds mm/win32/ to the PATH. Could you
  retry with ImageJ-win32.exe? I think the change was not actually needed.

- Could you try without 2010 runtime libraries in mm/Win32/? I think they
  are needed, but it would be nice to know.

- The name &quot;intermediate&quot; suggests that Micro-Manager's build process does
  something funny to that manifest. Could you please check that? &quot;git grep
  intermediate&quot; should tell

Thank you!
Dscho
