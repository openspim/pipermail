Great!

Well, it seems you hit a bug in the updater here because it should not
matter at all in which order the upgrades are applied.

If it happens again, may I ask you to just zip up the complete
(non-working) OpenSpim.app/ directory and upload it via Help&gt;Upload Sample
File?

Cool! When you have a working setup, maybe you could take a photo and post
information here: <A HREF="http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F">http://openspim.org/Who_has_an_OpenSPIM%3F</A>

Ciao,
