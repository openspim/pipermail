<PRE>Hello Alexis,

A little over a month ago, we finished rebasing the OpenSPIM source code onto the (then) latest Micro-Manager code. If you fully update your OpenSPIM installation (Help -&gt; Update Fiji), when you launch Micro-Manager it should register as 'v1.4.x dev' (I believe the code was between 1.4.13 and 1.4.14). I just tested now (Windows XP, freshly up-to-date OpenSPIM-20130131.zip, with an Orca R^2), and the software can load the mmgr_dal_HamamatsuHam.dll file included in the latest MM nightly build. I can't make any certain statements about support for Windows 7, unfortunately, since our goal at present is to maximize support for Windows XP first.


Regarding the development environment, I'm actively working on bringing it up-to-date, and your assistance in this would be invaluable -- I was hoping you might test something for me: Please try downloading <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57890359/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130529.exe</A> and installing it. This is a newer version of the installer, and hopefully should at least finish putting everything into place.


You are also correct about the necessary steps for building a functional OpenSPIM installation. To answer your questions:
1. a) I believe the mmstudio project only has the device adapters as dependencies to ensure they are built at all. You should be able to build it without compiling them first.
b) mmstudio is meant to be built by ant -- using the build32.xml file in its directory. However, the Visual Studio project has been configured to do just that, as long as your directory structure has '3rdpartypublic' alongside 'micromanager'.


2. The SPIM Acquisition plugin is also built by ant. Unfortunately, there isn't a neat way to do this quite yet -- you can call it from the command line (within plugins/SPIMAcquisition) with ../../../3rdpartypublic/apache-ant-1.6.5/bin/ant -buildfile build.xml


A few extra notes regarding compiling from source:
- Please make sure you're using the latest version of the source code, obtained from github.com/openspim -- preferably using Git for Windows.
- If you're feeling a little daring and haven't already done so, I'd recommend moving to Visual C++ 2010 Express, available for free from Microsoft. The latest code from github includes the project and solution files used by 2010, and even an (experimental) build script -- build-openspim.sh, meant to replace build.sh -- which builds the necessary objects.


Thank you for your help,
Luke Stuyvenberg

&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I use an ORCA Flash4 in our OpenSPIM setup but I run into severe problems regarding its integration with the OpenSPIM software. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The latest DCAM drivers (Feb 2013) brought compatibility with windows 7 (what we run on) and allow the integration and use of e.g. an Orca Flash4 in micro-manager (MM v1.4.13) using the HamamatsuHam device adapter . I tested this in a standalone MM and it works great. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, as the current micro-manager code base used by OpenSPIM is anterior (seems to be MM v1.4.9), this latest HamamatsuHam device adapter is not recognised/loaded by the OpenSPIM software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I am mistaken, in order to have this HamamatsuHam device adapter compatible with OpenSPIM, the OpenSPIM/MicroManager code has to be brought in sync to the current MM version 1.4.13/14; which in other words mean, recompiling OpenSPIM using the latest Micromanager source code, correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been struggling for several weeks now to try to do just that…
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, and unfortunately for me, the OpenSPIM development environment installer (<A HREF="http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130201.exe">http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-dev-env-20130201.exe</A>) which is supposed to make it really easy for everyone, did not work for me (it hangs and does not fetch the different sources). So I had to go the &quot;hard way&quot; and download, configure everything properly (d/l the boostPro libs, Ant, JDK, PATHs configurations, etc…). After a few hours of sweating, I troubleshooted almost everything. However, I am far from the described step &quot; by clicking on Build&gt;Build Solution or by pressing the F7 key&quot; everything builds auto-magically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I understood correctly, to get a functional OpenSPIM software compatible with MM v1.4.13, I have to , a minima, recompile:
</I>&gt;<i> - MMCore
</I>&gt;<i> - MMcoreJ_wrap
</I>&gt;<i> - Any DeviceAdapter I need (OpenSPIM, Cobolt, etc…) or on which the MMCoreJ_wrap depends (SerialManager, …)
</I>&gt;<i> - mmstudio
</I>&gt;<i> - SPIMAcquisition
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have questions regarding the last 2:
</I>&gt;<i> - mmstudio: about 40 devices adapters are listed as dependencies (AAOTF, etc…). Do I have to recompile them or it will be OK to forget about them (assuming I do not need them) or adding them from the current MM release? It is unclear whether I can recompile this in Visual Studio or using Ant. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - SPIMAcquisition: that's a JAVA plugin how do I do that? Using Ant?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have the feeling that I am getting lost in territories that have been charted by others before. 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I could really benefit from help of any good samaritans in the community to point me into the right directions to help me recompile the whole OpenSPIM using a more recent MM code base. In my opinion, this effort would actually benefit the whole community, as I am probably not the only one which may suffer from OpenSPIM being based on a several-month old MM release. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis
