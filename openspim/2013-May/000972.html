<PRE>Hi Johannes,

We are making good progress on our Open SPIM project.  Machining almost 
done and we just received the USB Pickard stage.

I'm now trying the get the software working.  I use Fiji all the time 
for image processing (great package and a pleasure to use) and so am 
familiar with installation and operation.  But when I installed the 
OpenSPIM version and opened MicroManager Studio I get the following 
error window:

Failed to open libMMCoreJ_wrap.jnilib
mmcorej.MMCoreJJNI.swig_module_init()V

The MM window opens, but when I try to run the Hardware config wizard I 
get the following:

org.micromanager.MMStudioMainFrame.run HardwareWizard 
(MMStudioMainFrame.java:4763)

which I'm guessing is due to the first error.

I looked around at the MM forum for some ideas on what might be wrong 
and even tried copying the MMCoreJ_wrap.dll into the OpenSPIM root 
directory, but still have the error.

Is there something wrong with my XP environment variables or is there a 
path I need to configure?

Thanks for any help.

Wade
