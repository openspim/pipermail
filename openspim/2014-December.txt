Dear Gabriel,

It is best to direct these types of questions regarding OpenSPIM to the
OpenSPIM listserver (openspim at openspim.org). I have CC:ed Ulrik G?nther
who is best equipped to answer your question.

Thank you for your time and understanding in advance.

Best Regards,
Pete

Dear spimmy people,

here is a mail intending to start the process of finally moving all of our
modifications to the Micro-Manager source code upstream (dropping
inappropriate or obsolete modifications, of course):

	http://sourceforge.net/p/micro-manager/mailman/message/33110030/

Subject: [OpenSPIM] advice on purchasing a laser intensity meter
Message-ID: <D3099CE6-AEA5-4B05-96BB-C747818BFAB4@uni-koeln.de>

Dear OpenSPIM Listers,

as some of our university funds dry up at the end of year, we thought to purchase a simple laser intensity meter to measure the output of the lasers in the sample chamber of our mDSLM, equipped with the following lines:

? 488 nm diode laser
? 561 nm DPSS solid-state laser (AOM)
? 638 nm diode laser

I don't have the nominal maximum output intensities of these lasers at hand (they're 20-40mW), but we should anyway stay within physiological values at the end of the light path. 

I asked Newport for some advice and their most economical combination would be the 818-SL/DB head with the 843-R handheld meter. Advisable? Or could anyone maybe recommend another manufacturer and/or device? We're not interested in measuring the exact wavelength, intensity only.


thanks in advance for any feedback!

Maarten

Hi ,
I am building a system and planning to have instead of one laser cube, the VersaLase system that accommodate 4 laser.
I wonder whether I can get some additional info with regards to the layout of the openspim with a multi lasers system (pictures maybe?) and what is the additional optics/parts that I would need to have in order to have it up and running and how to make the right adjustments.

Thanks for your help.
