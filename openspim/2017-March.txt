Subject: [OpenSPIM] sharp widefield image, but out of focus FP emmission
Message-ID: <CAL-PicK9NO1jJATpr5E-4i30VKRgQ9zByF6GXzxXT61N3N+ouQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OpenSPIMers,


We are building an openSPIM with a 100x detection objective as only major
adaptation. Our light sheet is nicely shaped and thin, and if we look at
our sample using a white light LED opposite of the detection objective, it
is in focus. However, if we turn on the laser, we can not get the GFP
emission light in focus. This seems odd, as our wide field image *is* in
focus.

We are quite certain the laser is properly aligned, and we did try moving
the light sheet through our sample. Any ideas what else we can try?


Thanks in advance,

Jaap van Krugten

Hey Jaap,

This does sound like light sheet alignment to me. It will be a lot more difficult with a 100x lens than it is with a 10-20x. When looking into your chamber from top, do you see a nicely focused beam close to the focal plane of your detection objective?
Next, just use water, remove cylindrical lens and emission filter and try to bring the focus of your laser beam into the field of view. Keep in mind that the vertical position of your laser (y in your FOV) might be off as well.

Best,
Michael

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Besides firewire,
	is there any reason to use a MacBook to SPIM?
Message-ID: <CAOsEyeL_cYo3qK9catG4G+PvmRNvG29ct3cwVi1cfMzN6t4SCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

We have decided to build a SPIM using almost the exact specs that are
published in the wiki.
The example from the wiki used a MacBook Pro laptop running windows so that
the firewire port could be utilized.  It seems that most new cameras use
USB ports with an option of some proprietary connector like cameralink for
faster acquisition.  in fact, none of the cameras we are considering use
firewire.
Isn't it more straightforward to just use a PC laptop and run the camera
through USB?

Thanks for your time!
Kevin

Hello Kevin,


back when the original version was written, the MacBook Pro was a good choice, due to it’s FireWire connector. 


Nowadays, if you are not in other ways committed to the Mac ecosystem, I would very much recommend _not_ to use a Mac as an acquisition machine at all, as the Mac hardware at the moment is pretty overpriced — you get much better specs with a “normal” notebook. If you are not aiming for a transportable system, I would even recommend against a notebook at all, as the money would be better invested in having faster/more disk/SSD storage, or a better graphics card for postprocessing.


I hope this was helpful! Let me know if you have more questions :-)

The specs for the workstation look good. NVMe SSDs offer lower latencies and higher transfer rates, as they connect directly to the PCIe bus instead of SATA, I’d take these — especially as they are not as expensive anymore as they used to be. If you can get 64 GB of RAM, do it. You are not going to regret having more memory available when processing your data, especially if you acquire multiview data.


Regarding the notebook for a transportable solution, it depends on how powerful you want it to be. For the Suitcase OpenSPIM we use for demo purposes, we still use the “original” MacBook sometimes, it is sufficient for simple tasks, such as demoing the microscope at outreach events.
 
But if you want to put a USB3.0 sCMOS camera in the mobile version, I’d aim for a mobile workstation-type notebook, like these: http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m7710-workstation/pd


Instead, if you only want to use a lower data-rate camera, like the Thorlabs DCC3000 series USB3 cams, a regular consumer notebook with about 8GB of RAM, and an SSD is sufficient.


What cameras do you plan to use on the systems?


Hope this helped!


cheers,


ulrik

Hi Ulrik,

We haven't decided on a camera, yet. We are going to demo the hammamatsu
Orca 4, the Andor Xylan and maybe the Prime 95b. Do you have any
suggestions/recommendations?

Thanks,
Kevin

Message-ID: <ACB4A8A0-FCA9-4C46-B550-73425FC345F6@g.ucla.edu>

Hi All,

We're in the process of building an OpenSPIM. 

We’ll be using the standard Olympus 10x objective for illumination, and the 16X Nikon CFI 0.8NA for detection in an L configuration.

Does anybody happen to have modified designs for the sample chamber, chamber holder, and objective holder ring that will fit this objective?

Thanks a lot for any help!
Alon
