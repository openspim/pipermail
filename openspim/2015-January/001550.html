This is awesome news. Please keep in mind that I started migrating the 
OpenSPIM plugin for Micro-Manager into its own repository: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition">https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition</A>

It is now organized as a Maven project which means that you can simply 
import into your development environment of choice.

My original plan (with which I tasked a student who was working on the 
software at that time) was to get the plugin included in Micro-Manager 
proper, but unfortunately the plugin has already way too many 
dependencies that are only available in Fiji and not in Micro-Manager 
(and it would be unreasonable to ask the Micro-Manager developers to 
include them just for OpenSPIM).


And yes, if time was less of a concern, then we would already have

- a split between the parts of OpenSPIM that truly need libraries 
shipped only with Fiji and the parts that only need what Micro-Manager 
provides out of the box

- a way to test inside Eclipse, including mock devices including a 
twister

- regression tests

It would be really nice to have, but I simply do not have the time to 
make any of the above a reality.

All the better that you need to work at least on some part of the 
software :-) Please feel more than welcome to ask any question you have 
about the OpenSPIM or Micro-Manager source code; I will try to address 
as many as possible, after all: the more we work together and help each 
other, the better the OpenSPIM project will benefit every one of us.

Ciao,
Johannes
