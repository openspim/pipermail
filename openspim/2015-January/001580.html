<PRE>Hi Dylan,

Unfortunately I cannot see the mail. And I could not see any previous 
attempts to subscribe, either, so I allowed myself to subscribe you 
directly.

&gt;<i> After reading the recent post regarding SPIM at x64, I am trying to

Please provide the full information, including all relevant log files 
that you can find. Even if they do not make sense to you, they might 
help others to help you.

&gt;<i> I have installed my Andor drivers and followed
</I>&gt;<i> the steps to install all the software but despite the new SPIM plugin,
</I>&gt;<i> it does not run at all.
</I>
Again, a detailed error report is required to help you. If Micro-Manager 
crashes, or if it shows you an error message, or if another message pops 
up; all of that is crucial information that is required to help you make 
sense of the problem and resolve it.

&gt;<i> In addition, when trying to load my
</I>&gt;<i> configuration the program continues to freeze and crash.
</I>
That description is unfortunately not precise enough to identify the 
problem. You probably have a CoreLog in your OpenSPIM.app/CoreLogs/ 
directory that should shed light into the issues.

&gt;<i> I know it is still not yet finished being fixed but I was just
</I>&gt;<i> wandering if there is a temporary fix for this?
</I>
Unfortunately, it is not possible with specific information (such as the 
information provided by the CoreLog) to know enough about the problem in 
order to assess any possible fix. Please copy &amp; paste precise error 
messages whenever possible, otherwise write them into a mail as 
faithfully as possible, and attach the relevant (parts of the) CoreLog.

Once you do that, I am confident that you will find the OpenSPIM 
community to be helpful in getting your system to work, hopefully so 
much that you also help others to get their systems to work, too.

Ciao,
Johannes
