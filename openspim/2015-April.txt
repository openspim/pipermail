Subject: [OpenSPIM] T-SPIM and L-SPIM configuration
Message-ID: <CAH+O61Hg750WVOUDjG86ZdqCyOeZh1eJVTsRz4mCRwNCtd9qZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Spimmers,

I recently got a grant approval to build what I believe is the first
OpenSPIM system in Brazil.

I would like to update the parts list since, for example, Coherent no
longer produces Cube systems replaced by Obis systems.

I also would like to show both T-SPIM and L-SPIM configurations in the
parts list page. Of course the three lenses design chamber will have to be
released by Pete Pitrone.

Last but not least, reading Reynaud and colleagues commentary published
this January on Nature I was taken aback by the information "that roughly
50 OpenSPIM systems are being built around the world" and we have only 7
listed on the wiki page. Is there any suggestion on how to improve the
share of ideas and solutions on the openspim webpage and not only in this
email list?

Thanks all of you for the information sharing and hard work on developing
the OpenSPIM.

Best regards

I can acquire a stack and save it to disk, but whenever I try to start
acquisition with an output directory specified, I get the error.

I installed the new 64 bit version, and all works fine except I get a

Subject: [OpenSPIM] HiRes Picard stage: the solution!
Message-ID: <op.xw8r2pn3ahhlbl@pc511-7cad.ibd>

Hi,

as I wrote previously, I have the new version of the Picard stage and I  
had issues with the maximum available position being limited to 32 767  
steps, and the slider in the plugin being limited to 9000 um. The solution  
that works for me is:

1) replace PiUSB.dll with the newest version from the Picard website -  
this fixes the 32 767 steps problem
2) I modified the SPIMAcquisition code so that the slider reflects the  
values of Max set during device configuration (where you also set the  
serial numbers). My code is currently here:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/compare/master...pawlowska:addMaxPropertyReading
I assume that the max value you set during configuration is the maxiumum  
number of STEPS (not um)

maybe this helps somebody.

It would appear as if OMERO might have broken Bio-Formats' 
backwards-compatibility once again... Exceptions like this one mean that 
the method setPixelsPhysicalSizeX(PositiveFloat) was available at 
compile time but is no longer available at runtime.

And indeed, it looks as if IMetadata by virtue of extending 
ome.xml.meta.MetadataStore defines only the following 
setPixelsPhysicalSizeX() method:

   public abstract void setPixelsPhysicalSizeX(ome.units.quantity.Length, 
int);

I fear that we will have to update the SPIMAcquisition plugin in a hurry 
to conform with the new Bio-Formats version that was so overzealously 
uploaded to the Fiji update site despite breaking backwards 
compatibility in a rather blatant way.

My calendar is densely packed, though, so I have no idea when I will get 
around to fix it (hint: help appreciated).

Ciao,
Johannes

  Hello Aurelia and Johannes,


I modified the OMETiffHandler to use the new Units API of BioFormats, you can find the changes at?https://github.com/skalarproduktraum/SPIMAcquisition/tree/OMEUnitFixes


Question to Johannes: Do you want a pull request for that? The issue I?m currently having is that it works just fine in Fiji with the MM update site, but not with the latest MM nightly, as it brings an older ome-xml version. Suggestions?


cheers,


ulrik

Whenever some code in OpenSPIM has been improved, or for that matter, in 
any Open Source software I maintain, I want a Pull Request. Otherwise 
the software would not improve but deteriorate, wouldn't it?

So was that a trick question?

My suggestion is not new.

My suggestion is to finally work together on having *the same* software 
versions in all OpenSPIM setups, by using the update site. We already 
have a beautiful update site, but nobody took care so far to get it back 
up-to-date, right? So now everybody and her dog has to work just as hard 
as everybody else to get to a working state, and nobody benefits from 
anybody else's work (the Pull Requests that have been opened and merged 
have been a really nice exception).

I know that it is typically highly discouraged in scientific work to 
work with other groups: after all, you could write papers, and even 
scoop other groups, instead of working on something that benefits them 
as well as yourself, right? This, however, is not the idea behind 
OpenSPIM. The idea of OpenSPIM is that when everybody works a little, 
everybody benefits a *lot*.

So let's work everybody a little on the software. Preferably in a way 
that other people do not have to solve the same problem that you solved, 
*again*. Rather, in a way where each problem is solved such that nobody 
else has to bother with the same problem. Whether you share your 
solution as a mail to this list, as an edit to the wiki, as a Pull 
Request, just share it.

Then we all will benefit.

Ciao,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] 64-bit Fiji Memory Limit Issue
Message-ID: <1429543916741.90268@ucl.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,


This is probably a wider issue with Fiji than OpenSPIM, but I was wondering if anyone else encountered the same problem we are having.


For reference, we are running 64-bit Windows 7 on a monster machine with 64GB RAM, an Intel Xeon E5-2650 and an nVidia Quadro 5000.


We generally run the 32-bit version of OpenSPIM for acquisition, but opening large image datasets (such as the ones in the Registation tutorial: http://openspim.org/Registration) results in Fiji reaching its memory limit. Because of this, I downloaded the 64-bit version of OpenSPIM/MM/Fiji in an attempt to increase the memory limit.


If I set the memory limit to a large value (20,000 MB) by going to Edit > Options > Memory & Threads, I get the same error message, as below:


Loading C:\Users\SPIM\Documents\OpenSPIM Dresden Data\tiffs\\spim_TL05_Angle0.tif
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is really odd, because if I go to Help > About ImageJ, it says that 13MB out of 20000MB (<1%) is in use. Put another way, Fiji accepts that I want to increase the memory limit, but it still doesn't use more than 505MB of memory.

As a sanity check, I have installed 64-bit Fiji on my office computer and I can open the Registration tutorial data there, but my personal computer is really slow at manipulating the large datasets!

Has anyone else experienced this problem? Or does anyone have any suggestions for how to solve the issue?

It's really frustrating as our behemoth PC refuses to do what it was bought to do!

Many thanks in advance for any replies.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] 64-bit Fiji Memory Limit Issue



 
Hi everyone,
 
 

 
 
This is probably a wider issue with Fiji than OpenSPIM, but I was wondering if anyone else encountered the same problem we are having.
 
 

 
 
For reference, we are running 64-bit Windows 7 on a monster machine with 64GB RAM, an Intel Xeon E5-2650 and an nVidia Quadro 5000.
 

 
 
We generally run the 32-bit version of OpenSPIM for acquisition, but opening large image datasets (such as the ones in the Registation tutorial: http://openspim.org/Registration) results in  Fiji reaching its memory limit. Because of this, I downloaded the 64-bit version of OpenSPIM/MM/Fiji in an attempt to increase the memory limit. 
 
 

 
 
If I set the memory limit to a large value (20,000 MB) by going to Edit > Options > Memory & Threads, I get the same error message, as below:
 
 

 
 Loading C:\Users\SPIM\Documents\OpenSPIM Dresden Data\tiffs\\spim_TL05_Angle0.tif
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 
 <Out of memory>
 
 <All available memory (505MB) has been>
 <used. To make more available, use the>
 <Edit>Options>Memory & Threads command.>
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 
 
 This is really odd, because if I go to Help > About ImageJ, it says that 13MB out of 20000MB (<1%) is in use. Put another way, Fiji accepts that I want to increase the memory limit, but it still doesn't use more than 505MB of memory.

Are you really certain that this is the 64-bit version? If you click 
into the status area of the main window, it will not only report the 
current available memory, but also the Java version and architecture.

Hi Johannes (& Zheng),

Thanks for the replies.

So, I have mFiji located on my desktop. If I click into the Fiji window it says the following:

(Fiji Is Just) ImageJ 2.0.0-rc-29/1.49q; Java 1.6.0_31 [64-bit]; 11MB of 20000MB (<1%).

Thanks,
Tom

Unfortunately I cannot support mFiji. It is unclear from which sources 
it was built/put together, and whether those sources are available to be 
to begin with.

Having said that...

Assuming that you use this 64-bit Fiji with the SPIM reconstruction, 
please note that that plugin is a bit wasteful with resources, i.e. it 
does not release memory necessarily as soon as it does not need it 
anymore. I remember that we had problems to reconstruct some data in 
Madison until we moved to a computer with 128GB (!!!).

To verify that this could be the problem, I would suggest to monitor the 
memory consumption by calling Plugins>Utilities>Monitor Memory... before 
starting to process the data. It should be relatively obvious from the 
monitor window and the log which steps in the reconstruction take that 
much memory (if I am correct in my assumption that there is a memory 
pseudo-leak, of course).

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello OpenSPIMagers,

I just added a Jenkins job that automatically builds the latest OpenSPIM 
source code:

http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/

For example, if you are curious whether Monika's recent fixes help your 
use case, you can now download the latest .jar file and test it in your 
setup.

Hi,

I uploaded a 64-bit version of the OpenSPIM software that reflects the 
setup when unpacking Fiji for 64-bit Windows and activating the OpenSPIM 
update site (after spending the last few weeks on getting the 
code/update site back on track). It would be good if users with a 64-bit 
Windows could download & test 
http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-20150427.zip and report back on 
this list.

Thank you,
Johannes

I just tested this myself with our hardware setup in Dresden and it all 
works fine.

For the record, the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit distribution is 
so small, the next time I upload a new complete package, it will be a 
combined one. This only adds ~10MB to the download but makes maintenance 
easier.

Ciao,
Johannes

P.S.: The new package -- as well as the current contents of the OpenSPIM 
update site -- also contain the fixes I made for the problem we had with 
the recent Bio-Formats update.

I activated the update site for openspim, updated all, restarted, 
acquired a test stack of 3 images, all seems fine. Thanks Johannes!!!

Message-ID: <CAH+O61Hg750WVOUDjG86ZdqCyOeZh1eJVTsRz4mCRwNCtd9qZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Spimmers,

I recently got a grant approval to build what I believe is the first
OpenSPIM system in Brazil.

I would like to update the parts list since, for example, Coherent no
longer produces Cube systems replaced by Obis systems.

I also would like to show both T-SPIM and L-SPIM configurations in the
parts list page. Of course the three lenses design chamber will have to be
released by Pete Pitrone.

Last but not least, reading Reynaud and colleagues commentary published
this January on Nature I was taken aback by the information "that roughly
50 OpenSPIM systems are being built around the world" and we have only 7
listed on the wiki page. Is there any suggestion on how to improve the
share of ideas and solutions on the openspim webpage and not only in this
email list?

Thanks all of you for the information sharing and hard work on developing
the OpenSPIM.

Best regards

I can acquire a stack and save it to disk, but whenever I try to start
acquisition with an output directory specified, I get the error.

I installed the new 64 bit version, and all works fine except I get a
similar error:

Subject: [OpenSPIM] HiRes Picard stage: the solution!
Message-ID: <op.xw8r2pn3ahhlbl@pc511-7cad.ibd>

Hi,

as I wrote previously, I have the new version of the Picard stage and I  
had issues with the maximum available position being limited to 32 767  
steps, and the slider in the plugin being limited to 9000 um. The solution  
that works for me is:

1) replace PiUSB.dll with the newest version from the Picard website -  
this fixes the 32 767 steps problem
2) I modified the SPIMAcquisition code so that the slider reflects the  
values of Max set during device configuration (where you also set the  
serial numbers). My code is currently here:
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/compare/master...pawlowska:addMaxPropertyReading
I assume that the max value you set during configuration is the maxiumum  
number of STEPS (not um)

maybe this helps somebody.

Hi Aurelia,

It would appear as if OMERO might have broken Bio-Formats' 
backwards-compatibility once again... Exceptions like this one mean that 
the method setPixelsPhysicalSizeX(PositiveFloat) was available at 
compile time but is no longer available at runtime.

And indeed, it looks as if IMetadata by virtue of extending 
ome.xml.meta.MetadataStore defines only the following 
setPixelsPhysicalSizeX() method:

   public abstract void setPixelsPhysicalSizeX(ome.units.quantity.Length, 
int);

I fear that we will have to update the SPIMAcquisition plugin in a hurry 
to conform with the new Bio-Formats version that was so overzealously 
uploaded to the Fiji update site despite breaking backwards 
compatibility in a rather blatant way.

My calendar is densely packed, though, so I have no idea when I will get 
around to fix it (hint: help appreciated).

Ciao,
Johannes

  Hello Aurelia and Johannes,


I modified the OMETiffHandler to use the new Units API of BioFormats, you can find the changes at https://github.com/skalarproduktraum/SPIMAcquisition/tree/OMEUnitFixes


Question to Johannes: Do you want a pull request for that? The issue I’m currently having is that it works just fine in Fiji with the MM update site, but not with the latest MM nightly, as it brings an older ome-xml version. Suggestions?


cheers,


ulrik

Whenever some code in OpenSPIM has been improved, or for that matter, in 
any Open Source software I maintain, I want a Pull Request. Otherwise 
the software would not improve but deteriorate, wouldn't it?

So was that a trick question?

My suggestion is not new.

My suggestion is to finally work together on having *the same* software 
versions in all OpenSPIM setups, by using the update site. We already 
have a beautiful update site, but nobody took care so far to get it back 
up-to-date, right? So now everybody and her dog has to work just as hard 
as everybody else to get to a working state, and nobody benefits from 
anybody else's work (the Pull Requests that have been opened and merged 
have been a really nice exception).

I know that it is typically highly discouraged in scientific work to 
work with other groups: after all, you could write papers, and even 
scoop other groups, instead of working on something that benefits them 
as well as yourself, right? This, however, is not the idea behind 
OpenSPIM. The idea of OpenSPIM is that when everybody works a little, 
everybody benefits a *lot*.

So let's work everybody a little on the software. Preferably in a way 
that other people do not have to solve the same problem that you solved, 
*again*. Rather, in a way where each problem is solved such that nobody 
else has to bother with the same problem. Whether you share your 
solution as a mail to this list, as an edit to the wiki, as a Pull 
Request, just share it.

Then we all will benefit.

Ciao,
Johannes

Subject: [OpenSPIM] 64-bit Fiji Memory Limit Issue
Message-ID: <1429543916741.90268@ucl.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,


This is probably a wider issue with Fiji than OpenSPIM, but I was wondering if anyone else encountered the same problem we are having.


For reference, we are running 64-bit Windows 7 on a monster machine with 64GB RAM, an Intel Xeon E5-2650 and an nVidia Quadro 5000.


We generally run the 32-bit version of OpenSPIM for acquisition, but opening large image datasets (such as the ones in the Registation tutorial: http://openspim.org/Registration) results in Fiji reaching its memory limit. Because of this, I downloaded the 64-bit version of OpenSPIM/MM/Fiji in an attempt to increase the memory limit.


If I set the memory limit to a large value (20,000 MB) by going to Edit > Options > Memory & Threads, I get the same error message, as below:


Loading C:\Users\SPIM\Documents\OpenSPIM Dresden Data\tiffs\\spim_TL05_Angle0.tif
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<Out of memory>
<All available memory (505MB) has been>
<used. To make more available, use the>
<Edit>Options>Memory & Threads command.>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is really odd, because if I go to Help > About ImageJ, it says that 13MB out of 20000MB (<1%) is in use. Put another way, Fiji accepts that I want to increase the memory limit, but it still doesn't use more than 505MB of memory.

As a sanity check, I have installed 64-bit Fiji on my office computer and I can open the Registration tutorial data there, but my personal computer is really slow at manipulating the large datasets!

Has anyone else experienced this problem? Or does anyone have any suggestions for how to solve the issue?

It's really frustrating as our behemoth PC refuses to do what it was bought to do!

Many thanks in advance for any replies.

Are you really certain that this is the 64-bit version? If you click 
into the status area of the main window, it will not only report the 
current available memory, but also the Java version and architecture.

Hi Johannes (& Zheng),

Thanks for the replies.

So, I have mFiji located on my desktop. If I click into the Fiji window it says the following:

(Fiji Is Just) ImageJ 2.0.0-rc-29/1.49q; Java 1.6.0_31 [64-bit]; 11MB of 20000MB (<1%).

Thanks,
Tom

Unfortunately I cannot support mFiji. It is unclear from which sources 
it was built/put together, and whether those sources are available to be 
to begin with.

Having said that...

Assuming that you use this 64-bit Fiji with the SPIM reconstruction, 
please note that that plugin is a bit wasteful with resources, i.e. it 
does not release memory necessarily as soon as it does not need it 
anymore. I remember that we had problems to reconstruct some data in 
Madison until we moved to a computer with 128GB (!!!).

To verify that this could be the problem, I would suggest to monitor the 
memory consumption by calling Plugins>Utilities>Monitor Memory... before 
starting to process the data. It should be relatively obvious from the 
monitor window and the log which steps in the reconstruction take that 
much memory (if I am correct in my assumption that there is a memory 
pseudo-leak, of course).

Ciao,
Johannes

Hello OpenSPIMagers,

I just added a Jenkins job that automatically builds the latest OpenSPIM 
source code:

http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/OpenSPIM/job/SPIMAcquisition/

For example, if you are curious whether Monika's recent fixes help your 
use case, you can now download the latest .jar file and test it in your 
setup.

Hi,

I uploaded a 64-bit version of the OpenSPIM software that reflects the 
setup when unpacking Fiji for 64-bit Windows and activating the OpenSPIM 
update site (after spending the last few weeks on getting the 
code/update site back on track). It would be good if users with a 64-bit 
Windows could download & test 
http://openspim.org/downloads/OpenSPIM-20150427.zip and report back on 
this list.

Thank you,
Johannes

I just tested this myself with our hardware setup in Dresden and it all 
works fine.

For the record, the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit distribution is 
so small, the next time I upload a new complete package, it will be a 
combined one. This only adds ~10MB to the download but makes maintenance 
easier.

Ciao,
Johannes

P.S.: The new package -- as well as the current contents of the OpenSPIM 
update site -- also contain the fixes I made for the problem we had with 
the recent Bio-Formats update.

Dear Johannes,
I downloaded this and am currently acquiring data with it, with no
problems.
Thank you very much!

I activated the update site for openspim, updated all, restarted, 
acquired a test stack of 3 images, all seems fine. Thanks Johannes!!!
