Subject: [OpenSPIM] Controlling Open SPIM Without lasers

I use the plugin without a laser connected all the time and it works, so  
it seems that your problem must be something else. The Picard stage has to  
be added 3 times: the rotation, the XY and the Z separately, and the  
serial numbers have to be changed. If this is done right, then it should  
be possible to move the XY and the Z stage via the Stage Control of  
Micro-Manager: https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Stage_Control . This is an  
independent way to check whether Micro-Manager sees the stages.

Regards,
Monika

Hi all,
Can I ask if this is the place to request help debugging the reconstruction/registration in Fiji? Or does that fall under the ImageJ listserv?

I'm having troubles getting rolling with the test data set and was hoping for some input.

Thanks

Hi All,

I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

Hi, Dylan,
    I also have the problem as you described, and I haven't fixed the problem yet. 
    I used the genetically modified Zebrafish to do the experiment, which makes the blood vessel fluorescent, so I didn't use the beads.
    In my situation, if I just moved the x or y position to do the experiment, the SPIM can do the registration at some situation (the overlap size between different stacks and the parameters you use to registration would affect the registration). 
    However, if I rotated the angle, the registration would fail. I also think that it's maybe the FEP tube is not straight, since when I rotated the angle, I had to change the x and y to move the fish back to screen.
    In one kind of Leica's light sheet microscope, it is not necessary to change angles to achieve 3D-image. it just move the x, y and z. Of cause, this method would lower the resolution in z-axis.
     If you make any progress in this problem, please tell me, Thank you!


P.S. you can try the software Vaa3D to do the stitch the stacks.

Dear Pavel,

Thank you for your email. I just ran the registrations again on a couple of datasets I had. They were taken at 60 degrees apart at 10 or 20x magnification. The logs correspond with the raw data I have uploaded on my onedrive if you want to have a look at those too:

http://1drv.ms/1M426qo

I have purchased some wider borosilicate capillaries that might help in both having more volume for beads and ensuring the tube is dead straight. Zhung, you might find that helpful? I will be running tests on them very soon so would let you know. I will also try Vaa3D, thanks for the suggestion.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Thanks again,

Dylan

Hello Dylan,

Can you tell me your light sheet alignment procedure that you do, hopefully before each experiment, maybe it could help exclude that possibility from the equation?

Hi Pete,

I have a cut micrometre slide stuck in a syringe which I use to check the laser sheet straightness as per OpenSPIM instructions followed by checking the embryos for image sharpness. I probably should be doing it with beads but I am more comfortable with an embryo as I am not 100% what an optimal bead scan would look like.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Hello Dylan,

Can you tell me your light sheet alignment procedure that you do, hopefully before each experiment, maybe it could help exclude that possibility from the equation?

Best Regards,
Pete

Dear Pavel,

Thank you for your email. I just ran the registrations again on a couple of datasets I had. They were taken at 60 degrees apart at 10 or 20x magnification. The logs correspond with the raw data I have uploaded on my onedrive if you want to have a look at those too:

http://1drv.ms/1M426qo

I have purchased some wider borosilicate capillaries that might help in both having more volume for beads and ensuring the tube is dead straight. Zhung, you might find that helpful? I will be running tests on them very soon so would let you know. I will also try Vaa3D, thanks for the suggestion.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Thanks again,

Dylan

Dear Dylan,




I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.



Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

PAvel





If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Subject: [OpenSPIM] "Acquire SPIM image" crash
Message-ID: <56422C00.2070600@fgu.cas.cz>

Dear all,
could anybody help me with the following software problem?

Micromanager knows all components of our SPIM system: CUBE laser, Picard stage, Andor camera. I can use all of them independently without troubles in MM: opening and closing laser shutter, moving with the stage in "Stage Control", seeing images in "Live" view. However, when opening "Acquire SPIM image", nothing happens and the Java exceptions are then in the corelog,  please, see the attachments.

Thank you very much for your help and comments!
Martin

Hi Martin,

Maybe, I can help in this case. However, the problem is that I cannot reproduce that error because I have a different setup.
One of my doubts is that we try to get the values from stages in the source code(https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/SPIMAcquisition.java#L1057-L1077 <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/SPIMAcquisition.java#L1057-L1077>).
It seemed to cause the error.

If you would not mind, I can provide you a custom-made plugin for verifying the problem, which might involve several (sending a plugin | receiving a result)+.
Then, I would be able to fix the bug. Please, let me know if you like this way.

Cheers,
HongKee

Hey Dylan,

I?ve started using a different technique for alignment that doesn?t require any thing at all (except for the media) in the sample chamber. I?ll describe it in short below:

- Either take out the sample, or move it well beyond the focal plane (far away from the detection objective)

- Take out all the filters blocking the laser from the camera (make sure that the laser is modulated way down to around ?1 mW)

- Take out the cylindrical lens(es)

- Go ?Live? at a short exposure time (10-25 ms)

You should see an in-focus beam in the middle of the field of view that cuts across the image, and it should slightly converge and then diverge with the narrowest point in the middle of the field of view. Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Best Regards,
Pete

I probably should be doing it with beads but I am more comfortable with an embryo as I am not 100% what an optimal bead scan would look like.

Of course you need to replace the Cylindrical lens to SPIMage again? Sent that last one too fast.

Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Hey Pete,

Thanks for the instructions, I will try them out ASAP. I am guessing you meant replacing the cylindrical lens after the alignment?

My laser cannot be attenuated that low but if I were to use an ND filter, would that affect the alignment process?

Kind regards,

Dylan

Hey Dylan,

I?ve started using a different technique for alignment that doesn?t require any thing at all (except for the media) in the sample chamber. I?ll describe it in short below:

- Either take out the sample, or move it well beyond the focal plane (far away from the detection objective)

- Take out all the filters blocking the laser from the camera (make sure that the laser is modulated way down to around ?1 mW)

- Take out the cylindrical lens(es)

- Go ?Live? at a short exposure time (10-25 ms)

You should see an in-focus beam in the middle of the field of view that cuts across the image, and it should slightly converge and then diverge with the narrowest point in the middle of the field of view. Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Dear Dylan,





I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

Howdy Dylan,

Go ahead and use an ND filter, it shouldn?t effect the process much at all? Sometimes I use them as well when the signal is too intense, but one can?t see any beads when it is in place.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] max acquisition depth
Message-ID: <5649F642.50104@fgu.cas.cz>

Dear OpenSPIM users,
I would have a question: In "Stack at this Z plus" it is possible to set 
maximum of 1500 microns. Is it possible to circumvent somehow this 
limitation? We need to acquire embryonic mouse hearts with greater 
diameter, thus having possibility to capture specimens up to 2.5-3 mm in 
depth would be useful. At the moment I acquire two consecutive stacks of 
optical sections for one xy position, but differing in z. Afterwards I 
stitch them together.
Moreover, having some tool that would be able to capture automatically a 
matrix of overlapping fields of view in xy with the same depth settings 
would be superior. I know, it is not easy to program. I am just 
describing what would be useful for us, since we work with relatively 
big pieces of fixed specimens, up to 4x4x4mm cubic.
Thank you very much for your help in advance!
Best regards,
Martin

Hi Pete, thanks for the info on the alignment.

Can I ask how the alignment of the cylindrical lens might affect things when you place it back in the path? You slide it to create the best focus on the conjugate mirror(?), but how sensitive are things to it being off axis, not quite perpendicular, or slightly rotated? Also, can you view these things via the camera using the scattered light too?

I apologise if these are silly questions; I've not aligned the system yet, just started bolting it down.

Thanks for your time
Neil

Howdy Dylan,

Go ahead and use an ND filter, it shouldn?t effect the process much at all? Sometimes I use them as well when the signal is too intense, but one can?t see any beads when it is in place.

Hey Dylan,

I?ve started using a different technique for alignment that doesn?t require any thing at all (except for the media) in the sample chamber. I?ll describe it in short below:

- Either take out the sample, or move it well beyond the focal plane (far away from the detection objective)

- Take out all the filters blocking the laser from the camera (make sure that the laser is modulated way down to around ?1 mW)

- Take out the cylindrical lens(es)

- Go ?Live? at a short exposure time (10-25 ms)

You should see an in-focus beam in the middle of the field of view that cuts across the image, and it should slightly converge and then diverge with the narrowest point in the middle of the field of view. Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Pete

Dear Pavel,

Thank you for your email. I just ran the registrations again on a couple of datasets I had. They were taken at 60 degrees apart at 10 or 20x magnification. The logs correspond with the raw data I have uploaded on my onedrive if you want to have a look at those too:

http://1drv.ms/1M426qo

I have purchased some wider borosilicate capillaries that might help in both having more volume for beads and ensuring the tube is dead straight. Zhung, you might find that helpful? I will be running tests on them very soon so would let you know. I will also try Vaa3D, thanks for the suggestion.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Dear Dylan,





I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.




Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

PAvel






If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Dylan

Hey Neil,

valid questions?

> how the alignment of the cylindrical lens might affect things when you place it back in the path?

Not much really? It doesn?t even seem to matter if the lens is closer or further away from the mirror by a full centimeter. BUT, I would still recommend putting it in focus/right place.

> how sensitive are things to it being off axis, not quite perpendicular, or slightly rotated?


Not very much. But there are ways to find out if it is though, although this requires a bead sample and the emission filter needs to be replaced into the infinity tube. 
 - For determining the rotation of the cylindrical lens, watch the top and bottom third of the field of view of the camera chip to make sure it is evenly illuminated.
 - For determining the ?perpendicularity? of the sheet, watch the left and right third of the field of view of the camera chip to make sure it is evenly illuminated. Here though you have to adjust mirrors? not fun.

> Also, can you view these things via the camera using the scattered light too?


Try, you?ll see how dirty your media is?

Message-ID: <CAEpSnnYDMdHSbvRSXbeTVF+m3Nff2faVSXiM6nx8C-oQnqGqhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are working on a MM v2 plugin which is based on imglib2 and scijava
infrastructure : https://github.com/bnoi/MAARS/tree/mm2Plugin

We are very interested in the way you created the build system for
SPIMAcquisition.

One of the question I have in mind is who is in charge of uploading MM
artifacts to ImageJ maven repo and how often is it updated ? We are
interested in regular update against mm2 branch of MM repo.

The second question is how do you deploy SPIMAcquisition to a regular MM
installation without the need of Eclipse/Netbeans/Maven to download all the
dependencies ? I saw the manual procedure here
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/tree/mm2#installing-into-a-micro-manager-directory-instead-of-fiji
but I wonder to know wether you have a more "automated" to deploy your
plugin on Windows machine for example.

Thanks

Dear All,

Has anyone ever had problems with corrupted z-stacks that looked like 
the attached one?

Since November 11th is has happened several times that time lapses run 
on our OpenSpim yielded 'normal' z-stacks for a varying number of time 
points and then started to produce these corrupted z-stacks.

Does anyone happen to know if this could be a MicroManager problem or 
what else it could be? We are using a Coolsnap Myo CCD camera from 
Photometrics. Re-installing their PVCam software did not fix the 
problem.

Thanks a lot and best wishes,

Stephanie

I use the plugin without a laser connected all the time and it works, so  
it seems that your problem must be something else. The Picard stage has to  
be added 3 times: the rotation, the XY and the Z separately, and the  
serial numbers have to be changed. If this is done right, then it should  
be possible to move the XY and the Z stage via the Stage Control of  
Micro-Manager: https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Stage_Control . This is an  
independent way to check whether Micro-Manager sees the stages.

Monika

I'm having troubles getting rolling with the test data set and was hoping for some input.

Hi All,

I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

Hi, Dylan,
    I also have the problem as you described, and I haven't fixed the problem yet. 
    I used the genetically modified Zebrafish to do the experiment, which makes the blood vessel fluorescent, so I didn't use the beads.
    In my situation, if I just moved the x or y position to do the experiment, the SPIM can do the registration at some situation (the overlap size between different stacks and the parameters you use to registration would affect the registration). 
    However, if I rotated the angle, the registration would fail. I also think that it's maybe the FEP tube is not straight, since when I rotated the angle, I had to change the x and y to move the fish back to screen.
    In one kind of Leica's light sheet microscope, it is not necessary to change angles to achieve 3D-image. it just move the x, y and z. Of cause, this method would lower the resolution in z-axis.
     If you make any progress in this problem, please tell me, Thank you!


P.S. you can try the software Vaa3D to do the stitch the stacks.

I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.
 
 
 
Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on  either side of the stack for bead registration?
 
 
 
If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Dear Pavel,

Thank you for your email. I just ran the registrations again on a couple of datasets I had. They were taken at 60 degrees apart at 10 or 20x magnification. The logs correspond with the raw data I have uploaded on my onedrive if you want to have a look at those too:

http://1drv.ms/1M426qo

I have purchased some wider borosilicate capillaries that might help in both having more volume for beads and ensuring the tube is dead straight. Zhung, you might find that helpful? I will be running tests on them very soon so would let you know. I will also try Vaa3D, thanks for the suggestion.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Thanks again,

Dylan

Dear Dylan,



I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.


Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

PAvel

Hello Dylan,

Can you tell me your light sheet alignment procedure that you do, hopefully before each experiment, maybe it could help exclude that possibility from the equation…

Hi Pete,

I have a cut micrometre slide stuck in a syringe which I use to check the laser sheet straightness as per OpenSPIM instructions followed by checking the embryos for image sharpness. I probably should be doing it with beads but I am more comfortable with an embryo as I am not 100% what an optimal bead scan would look like.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Message-ID: <56422C00.2070600@fgu.cas.cz>

Dear all,
could anybody help me with the following software problem?

Micromanager knows all components of our SPIM system: CUBE laser, Picard stage, Andor camera. I can use all of them independently without troubles in MM: opening and closing laser shutter, moving with the stage in "Stage Control", seeing images in "Live" view. However, when opening "Acquire SPIM image", nothing happens and the Java exceptions are then in the corelog,  please, see the attachments.

Thank you very much for your help and comments!
Martin

Hi Martin,

Maybe, I can help in this case. However, the problem is that I cannot reproduce that error because I have a different setup.
One of my doubts is that we try to get the values from stages in the source code(https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/SPIMAcquisition.java#L1057-L1077 <https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/blob/master/src/main/java/spim/SPIMAcquisition.java#L1057-L1077>).
It seemed to cause the error.

If you would not mind, I can provide you a custom-made plugin for verifying the problem, which might involve several (sending a plugin | receiving a result)+.
Then, I would be able to fix the bug. Please, let me know if you like this way.

Cheers,
HongKee

I can use all of them independently without troubles in MM: opening and closing laser shutter, moving with the stage in "Stage Control", seeing images in "Live" view. However, when opening "Acquire SPIM image", nothing happens and the Java exceptions are then in the corelog,  please, see the attachments.

Hey Dylan,

I’ve started using a different technique for alignment that doesn’t require any thing at all (except for the media) in the sample chamber. I’ll describe it in short below:

- Either take out the sample, or move it well beyond the focal plane (far away from the detection objective)

- Take out all the filters blocking the laser from the camera (make sure that the laser is modulated way down to around ±1 mW)

- Take out the cylindrical lens(es)

- Go “Live” at a short exposure time (10-25 ms)

You should see an in-focus beam in the middle of the field of view that cuts across the image, and it should slightly converge and then diverge with the narrowest point in the middle of the field of view. Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Best Regards,
Pete

Hey Pete,

Thanks for the instructions, I will try them out ASAP. I am guessing you meant replacing the cylindrical lens after the alignment?

My laser cannot be attenuated that low but if I were to use an ND filter, would that affect the alignment process?

Kind regards,

Dylan

Dear Dylan,





I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.




Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

PAvel






If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Howdy Dylan,

Go ahead and use an ND filter, it shouldn’t effect the process much at all… Sometimes I use them as well when the signal is too intense, but one can’t see any beads when it is in place.

Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Subject: [OpenSPIM] max acquisition depth
Message-ID: <5649F642.50104@fgu.cas.cz>

Dear OpenSPIM users,
I would have a question: In "Stack at this Z plus" it is possible to set 
maximum of 1500 microns. Is it possible to circumvent somehow this 
limitation? We need to acquire embryonic mouse hearts with greater 
diameter, thus having possibility to capture specimens up to 2.5-3 mm in 
depth would be useful. At the moment I acquire two consecutive stacks of 
optical sections for one xy position, but differing in z. Afterwards I 
stitch them together.
Moreover, having some tool that would be able to capture automatically a 
matrix of overlapping fields of view in xy with the same depth settings 
would be superior. I know, it is not easy to program. I am just 
describing what would be useful for us, since we work with relatively 
big pieces of fixed specimens, up to 4x4x4mm cubic.
Thank you very much for your help in advance!
Best regards,
Martin

Hi Pete, thanks for the info on the alignment.

Can I ask how the alignment of the cylindrical lens might affect things when you place it back in the path? You slide it to create the best focus on the conjugate mirror(?), but how sensitive are things to it being off axis, not quite perpendicular, or slightly rotated? Also, can you view these things via the camera using the scattered light too?

I apologise if these are silly questions; I've not aligned the system yet, just started bolting it down.

Thanks for your time
Neil

Hey Dylan,

I’ve started using a different technique for alignment that doesn’t require any thing at all (except for the media) in the sample chamber. I’ll describe it in short below:

- Either take out the sample, or move it well beyond the focal plane (far away from the detection objective)

- Take out all the filters blocking the laser from the camera (make sure that the laser is modulated way down to around ±1 mW)

- Take out the cylindrical lens(es)

- Go “Live” at a short exposure time (10-25 ms)

You should see an in-focus beam in the middle of the field of view that cuts across the image, and it should slightly converge and then diverge with the narrowest point in the middle of the field of view. Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Dear Dylan,





I have been trying to register Z-stacks of Zebrafish using the SPIM plugin with various concentrations of beads but despite everything I try I cannot get the beads to match with different angles.

I am not sure if this is because of the light sheet not being aligned properly (I am calculating the PSF very soon and will re-align the system from scratch) or due to sample prep etc. I have corrected bead drifting (as this was evident in low concentrations of agarose) and I am pretty sure the xy and z resolution numbers are correct. I will attempt the Multiview reconstruction package, FluoRender or even ClearVolume but without bead registration working I am not sure if that will work either.

Did you already run the multi-view reconstruction? Can you attach the ImageJ log.  I am particularly looking for numbers of beads and numbers of RANSAC inliers. That would be the way to start troubleshooting.




Would it be possible that if the FEP tube is not straight, the manual positioning of the next angles would misalign bead registration? I have also thought that as the embryo fills up the tube, I am not getting enough volume of beads on either side of the stack for bead registration?

That maybe a problem. There may be not enough beads in the OVERLAP between the views. You can visualise that in the Multiview Reconstruction application.

I will help more after you send the logs or even deposit the data somewhere.

All the best

PAvel






If anyone has had difficulty in this or have done work on Zebrafish with SPIM I would really appreciate any help.

Kind regards,

Dylan

Hey Neil,

valid questions…

> how the alignment of the cylindrical lens might affect things when you place it back in the path?

Not much really… It doesn’t even seem to matter if the lens is closer or further away from the mirror by a full centimeter. BUT, I would still recommend putting it in focus/right place.

> how sensitive are things to it being off axis, not quite perpendicular, or slightly rotated?


Not very much. But there are ways to find out if it is though, although this requires a bead sample and the emission filter needs to be replaced into the infinity tube. 
 - For determining the rotation of the cylindrical lens, watch the top and bottom third of the field of view of the camera chip to make sure it is evenly illuminated.
 - For determining the “perpendicularity” of the sheet, watch the left and right third of the field of view of the camera chip to make sure it is evenly illuminated. Here though you have to adjust mirrors… not fun.

> Also, can you view these things via the camera using the scattered light too?


Try, you’ll see how dirty your media is…

Pete

You slide it to create the best focus on the conjugate mirror(?), but how sensitive are things to it being off axis, not quite perpendicular, or slightly rotated? Also, can you view these things via the camera using the scattered light too?

Now you can adjust the conjugate plane (corner) mirror horizontally to correct any misalignment in terms of focus, and vertically to place it in the center across the field. The two lens telescope between the mirror and the illumination lens can be adjusted along the rail so the narrowest part of the beam is centered in the exact middle.

Hi,

We are working on a MM v2 plugin which is based on imglib2 and scijava
infrastructure : https://github.com/bnoi/MAARS/tree/mm2Plugin

We are very interested in the way you created the build system for
SPIMAcquisition.

One of the question I have in mind is who is in charge of uploading MM
artifacts to ImageJ maven repo and how often is it updated ? We are
interested in regular update against mm2 branch of MM repo.

The second question is how do you deploy SPIMAcquisition to a regular MM
installation without the need of Eclipse/Netbeans/Maven to download all the
dependencies ? I saw the manual procedure here
https://github.com/openspim/SPIMAcquisition/tree/mm2#installing-into-a-micro-manager-directory-instead-of-fiji
but I wonder to know wether you have a more "automated" to deploy your
plugin on Windows machine for example.

Thanks

Dear All,

Has anyone ever had problems with corrupted z-stacks that looked like 
the attached one?

Since November 11th is has happened several times that time lapses run 
on our OpenSpim yielded 'normal' z-stacks for a varying number of time 
points and then started to produce these corrupted z-stacks.

Does anyone happen to know if this could be a MicroManager problem or 
what else it could be? We are using a Coolsnap Myo CCD camera from 
Photometrics. Re-installing their PVCam software did not fix the 
problem.

Thanks a lot and best wishes,

Stephanie

Hey Stephanie,

I can’t say that I ever have… no, I haven’t. That is a really weird pattern.

What is the make and model of your camera?
