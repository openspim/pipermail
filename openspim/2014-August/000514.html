<PRE>Hi Aurelia,

Interestingly, the 'suggested' diffs didn't seem to be lining up all 
that often -- and there's certainly enough shape information there for 
the phase correlation to have corrected for the displacement... It may 
be that a change in imglib2 has caused these effects, but it could just 
as easily be that the suggested diffs are being written improperly. 
Perhaps the phase correlation algorithm has changed somehow, and it's 
picking non-ideal correlation shifts? (This could possibly cause the 
entirely-automatic corrections to under-correct.)

A few other ideas to check:

- Is it possible the camera or its firmware is reversing the image 
horizontally (as some webcams do, to produce the 'mirror' effect)? And 
is your camera mounted right-side up? i.e. is the top of the frame in 
the direction of the top of the sample chamber?
- Did the flip or mirror device settings have an effect? (I don't know 
that the PicardStage device adapter respects the 'flip' setting; a quirk 
in the MM programming made this next to impossible last time I tried.)
- How's the contrast/signal when looking at your sample?

This would be a lot less confusing if our earlier anti-drift tests had 
shown the same behavior! ;-)

As a final thought, could you try guiding the anti-drift through an 
entire acquisition? It would help narrow the search by determining if 
the automatic (phase-correlation) correction is to blame for this issue, 
or if the anti-drift in general is at fault.

</I>&gt;<i>     behavior of the anti-drift, and while it's not yet advanced enough
</I>&gt;<i>     for me to be certain there's no software fault here, I haven't
</I>&gt;<i>     been able to obtain these dramatic jerks so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     When anti-drift is on, the software produces a directory

</I>&gt;<i>     help identify any problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Hope these questions help shed some light on the issue,

</I>&gt;<i>         A sample log file showing the anti-drift corrections:
</I>&gt;<i>         TP 0 view 0: Offset: {8.6508; 0; 0}  (this x correction is the
</I>&gt;<i>         one I have put in)
</I>&gt;<i>         TP 0 view 0: Offset: {16.46055; -0.2493; 0}
</I>&gt;<i>         TP 0 view 0: Offset: {34.48305; 0.2403; 0}

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         It seems like there is a sign error of some kind, but I can't

</I>&gt;<i>         Any ideas?
