<PRE>Hi Luke,

Thanks!  I'll send you the anti-drift debugging images in a moment.  I
measured pixel size by taking a picture of my calibration grid and counting
pixels per line.  I only vaguely verified its accuracy by checking that the
displacement of the embryo in the composite image I sent before was about
the same as the correction listed in the anti-drift log file, and since
they match approximately, I didn't look further.  I could use the &quot;move a
bead with the stage&quot; method to check this more carefully, but it seems to
be about right.
The test is very repeatable, and in the case of making a small correction
to either Y or Z the stage moves to the suggested location and then doesn't
move significantly afterwards.
Let me know if you think of some more helpful test I could do.  I'm not
certain that there isn't some hardware oddity causing this, but so far I
haven't figured out what it could be.

Aurelia

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still having trouble with the anti-drift function, and I'm not sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how to proceed.  To explain the trouble, I made the following test: I set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up a 5-time point acquisition with only one view, turned on the anti-drift,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and made a manual correction to first one, then made no more adjustments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after that.  The frames are 100 seconds apart, so no significant actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drift should be occurring.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A sample log file showing the anti-drift corrections:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TP 0 view 0: Offset: {16.46055; -0.2493; 0}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TP 0 view 0: Offset: {34.48305; 0.2403; 0}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TP 0 view 0: Offset: {69.08625; -1.08135; 0}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like there is a sign error of some kind, but I can't figure out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way to change my configuration to correct it.  I have already switched
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the X and Y serial numbers in my configuration file, which improved things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a little (previously this test resulted in the embryo traveling in circles).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any ideas?
