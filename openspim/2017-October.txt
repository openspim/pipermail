Subject: [OpenSPIM] some bright thing in Fluorescent beads images
Message-ID: <177139809.4139044.1507707603244.JavaMail.zimbra@sjtu.edu.cn>

Hello, everyone.

This is Yan.
I used our openSPIM to take Fluorescent beads images as shown in the attachment, named figure-original.tif.
and I found there are some bright thing along with the beads, as marked by red circles in figure-part.tif.

I put the beads in water and water in chamber, then took images, there is no such bright thing in images.
But I put the beads in RMIS (RI=1.457), and the same in chamber, then there are such bright thing in images.

Is there anyone who knows possible reason for this bright thing in image? 
What can I do to delete such thing?

Thank you very much.
Yan

Dear Yan,

Those "things" seems to be all beyond the beads opposite from the light
sheet illumination? If so they maybe illumination artefacts due to the
combination of orthogonal laser light and your RMSI. You could easily
reduce exposure time by half and/or reduce laser power.
And to be sure check that your RMSI is clean...

Hi, Yan,

There might be something off with alignment of your system - the 
artefacts are stronger in the left part of the field.
Also, are you using a water-dipping objective with RMSI (RI = 1.457)? If 
the objective is not designed for this refractive index, PSFs will have 
aberrations.
I hope this helps,
Nikita

Subject: [OpenSPIM] Calibration using the target grid and mirror?
Message-ID: <CAGv7iOgjLjLOtJp+oudosP+1w=0Wdc5rxqJ=P+FB5UjH9owCww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

>From the wiki there is a method for calibration of the light sheet using a
grid (from a micrometer slide) and mirror attached to a syringe. We have
been having some trouble with calibration  in our prototype OpenSPIM system
and we have a few questions.

1. How did others extract the small grid from the calibration slide? How
was it attached to the calibration sample holder (syringe)?
2. Is the system calibrated every time before use or is it calibrated less
frequently? If it is calibrated often, how do you ensure that the grid is
stable for each position and it doesn't move ("wobble around") in the
chamber during the calibration?

Would anyone have any advice about this?

Thank you,
Kathleen

Kathleen,

Well, it depends on your micrometer slide... if it is an engraved coverslip
like the eppendorf system then you can glue it on a capillary that fits the
tip of the syringe (uncut) and mount it like that.
Basically, you take a syringe, insert a capillary in the tip, glue it, then
glue the grid/mirror on top of the capillary
Stability of the system is very variable. some system well isolated with no
moving parts and other motor vibrating around can be calibrated once before
the set of experiments and of you go and just check at the end for
security. Just a bit of try and error will tell you the best.
